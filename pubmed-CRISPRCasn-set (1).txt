TI  - A CRISPR-Cas autocatalysis-driven feedback amplification network for supersensitive 
      DNA diagnostics.

AB  - Artificial nucleic acid circuits with precisely controllable dynamic and function 
      have shown great promise in biosensing, but their utility in molecular diagnostics 
      is still restrained by the inability to process genomic DNA directly and moderate 
      sensitivity. To address this limitation, we present a CRISPR-Cas-powered catalytic 
      nucleic acid circuit, namely, CRISPR-Cas-only amplification network (CONAN), for 
      isothermally amplified detection of genomic DNA. By integrating the stringent target 
      recognition, helicase activity, and trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, a Cas12a 
      autocatalysis-driven artificial reaction network is programmed to construct a 
      positive feedback circuit with exponential dynamic in CONAN. Consequently, CONAN 
      achieves one-enzyme, one-step, real-time detection of genomic DNA with attomolar 
      sensitivity. Moreover, CONAN increases the intrinsic single-base specificity of 
      Cas12a, and enables the effective detection of hepatitis B virus infection and human 
      bladder cancer-associated single-nucleotide mutation in clinical samples, 
      highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for disease diagnostics.

AB  - The CRISPR-Cas system initiated a revolution in genome editing when it was, for the 
      first time, demonstrated success in the mammalian cells. Today, scientists are able 
      to readily edit genomes, regulate gene transcription, engineer posttranscriptional 
      events, and image nucleic acids using CRISPR-Cas-based tools. However, to 
      efficiently transport CRISPR-Cas into target tissues/cells remains challenging due 
      to many extra- and intra-cellular barriers, therefore largely limiting the 
      applications of CRISPR-based therapeutics in vivo. In this review, we summarize the 
      features of plasmid-, RNA- and ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based CRISPR-Cas 
      therapeutics. Then, we survey the current in vivo delivery systems. We specify the 
      requirements for efficient in vivo delivery in clinical settings, and highlight both 
      efficiency and safety for different CRISPR-Cas tools.

AB  - In this opinion article we highlight links between the H-NS nucleoid-associated 
      protein, variable DNA topology, the regulation of CRISPR-cas locus expression, 
      CRISPR-Cas activity, and the recruitment of novel genetic information by the CRISPR 
      array. We propose that the requirement that the invading mobile genetic element be 
      negatively supercoiled limits effective CRISPR action to a window in the bacterial 
      growth cycle when DNA topology is optimal, and that this same window is used for the 
      efficient integration of new spacer sequences at the CRISPR array. H-NS silences 
      CRISPR promoters, and we propose that antagonists of H-NS, such as the LeuO 
      transcription factor, provide a basis for a stochastic genetic switch that acts at 
      random in each cell in the bacterial population. In addition, we wish to propose a 
      mechanism by which mobile genetic elements can suppress CRISPR-cas transcription 
      using H-NS homologues. Although the individual components of this network are known, 
      we propose a new model in which they are integrated and linked to the physiological 
      state of the bacterium. The model provides a basis for cell-to-cell variation in the 
      expression and performance of CRISPR systems in bacterial populations.

AB  - Since its first demonstration for mammalian gene editing, CRISPR/Cas technology has 
      been widely adopted in research, industry, and medicine. Beyond indel mutations 
      induced by Cas9 activity, recent advances in CRISPR/Cas have enabled DNA or RNA base 
      editing. In addition, multiple orthogonal methods for the spatiotemporal regulation 
      of CRISPR/Cas activity and repurposed Cas proteins for the visualization and 
      relocation of specific genomic loci in living cells have been described. By 
      harnessing the versatility of CRISPR/Cas-based devices and gene circuits, synthetic 
      biologists are developing memory devices for lineage tracing and technologies for 
      unbiased, high-throughput interrogation of combinatorial gene perturbations. We 
      envision that such approaches will enable researchers to gain deeper insights into 
      the translation of genotypes to phenotypes in healthy and diseased states.

AB  - RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential modulators of transcription and 
      translation frequently dysregulated in cancer. We systematically interrogated RBP 
      dependencies in human cancers using a comprehensive CRISPR/Cas9 domain-focused 
      screen targeting RNA-binding domains of 490 classical RBPs. This uncovered a network 
      of physically interacting RBPs upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
      crucial for maintaining RNA splicing and AML survival. Genetic or pharmacologic 
      targeting of one key member of this network, RBM39, repressed cassette exon 
      inclusion and promoted intron retention within mRNAs encoding HOXA9 targets as well 
      as in other RBPs preferentially required in AML. The effects of RBM39 loss on 
      splicing further resulted in preferential lethality of spliceosomal mutant AML, 
      providing a strategy for treatment of AML bearing RBP splicing mutations.

AB  - The novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) can be considered as the most important current global issue, as it has 
      caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has resulted in high 
      mortality and morbidity rates all around the world. Although scientists are trying 
      to discover novel therapies and develop and evaluate various previous treatments, at 
      the time of writing this paper, there was no definite therapy and vaccine for 
      COVID-19. So, as COVID-19 has called ideas for treatment, controlling, and 
      diagnosis, we discussed the application of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 
      Palindromic Repeats/Cas13 (CRISPR/Cas13) as a treatment of COVID-19, which received 
      less attention compared with other potential therapeutic options.

AB  - DNA is the source of genetic information, and preserving its integrity is essential 
      in order to sustain life. The genome is continuously threatened by different types 
      of DNA lesions, such as abasic sites, mismatches, interstrand crosslinks, or 
      single-stranded and double-stranded breaks. As a consequence, cells have evolved 
      specialized DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms to sustain genome integrity. By 
      orchestrating multilayer signaling cascades specific for the type of lesion that 
      occurred, the DDR ensures that genetic information is preserved overtime. In the 
      last decades, DNA repair mechanisms have been thoroughly investigated to untangle 
      these complex networks of pathways and processes. As a result, key factors have been 
      identified that control and coordinate DDR circuits in time and space. In the first 
      part of this review, we describe the critical processes encompassing DNA damage 
      sensing and resolution. In the second part, we illustrate the consequences of 
      partial or complete failure of the DNA repair machinery. Lastly, we will report 
      examples in which this knowledge has been instrumental to develop novel therapies 
      based on genome editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that functions by incorporating 
      fragments of foreign DNA into CRISPR arrays. The arrays containing spacers derived 
      from foreign DNA are transcribed, and the transcripts are processed to generate 
      spacer-containing mature CRISPR-RNAs that are employed as guides to specifically 
      recognize and cleave the DNA or RNA of the cognate parasitic genetic elements. The 
      CRISPR-Cas systems show remarkable complexity and diversity of molecular 
      organization and appear to be involved in various cellular functions that are 
      distinct from, even if connected to, adaptive immunity. In this review, we discuss 
      some of such functional links of CRISPR-Cas systems including their effect on 
      horizontal gene transfer that can be either inhibitory or stimulatory, connections 
      between CRISPR-Cas and DNA repair systems as well as programmed cell death and 
      signal transduction mechanisms, and potential role of CRISPR-Cas in transposon 
      integration and plasmid maintenance. The interplay between the primary function of 
      CRISPR-Cas as an adaptive immunity mechanism and these other roles defines the 
      richness of the biological effects of these systems and affects their spread among 
      bacteria and archaea.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems have, over the years, emerged as indispensable tools for Genetic 
      interrogation in contexts of clinical interventions, elucidation of genetic pathways 
      and metabolic engineering and have pervaded almost every aspect of modern biology. 
      Within this repertoire, the nervous system comes with its own set of perplexities 
      and mysteries. Scientists have, over the years, tried to draw up a clearer genetic 
      picture of the neuron and how it functions in a network, mainly in an endeavor to 
      mitigate diseases of the human nervous system like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, 
      Huntington's, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), etc. With most being progressive in 
      nature, these diseases have plagued mankind for centuries. In spite of our immense 
      progress in modern biology, we are yet to get a grasp over these diseases and 
      unraveling their mechanisms is of utmost importance. Before CRISPR-Cas systems came 
      along, the elucidation of the complex interactome of the mammalian nervous system 
      was attempted with erstwhile existing electrophysiological, histological and 
      pharmacological techniques coupled with Next Generation Sequencing and cell-specific 
      targeting technologies. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription 
      activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), imparted excellent sequence specific DNA 
      targeting capabilities but came with their huge baggage of extensive protein 
      engineering requirements, which practically rendered them unsuitable for high 
      throughput exercises. With the discovery of Clustered Regularly Interspaced 
      Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR Associated proteins(CAS) systems by Ishino 
      (1987)(1), the era of extensive custom made endonuclease targeting was ushered in. 
      For the first time in 2012, Jinek et al. (2012)(2) repurposed the CRISPR-Cas 
      mediated bacterial immune system for customizable mammalian gene editing. The 
      CRISPR-Cas technology made it possible to easily customize Cas9 endonucleases to 
      cleave near specifically targeted sequences, thereby facilitating knock-ins or 
      knock-outs, silencing or activating or editing any gene, at any locus of the genome, 
      both at the base-pair level or at the epigenetic level. With this enhanced degree of 
      freedom, decrypting the nervous system and therapeutic interventions for 
      neuropathies became significantly less cumbersome an exercise. Here we take a brisk 
      walk through the several endeavors of research that show how the humble bacteria's 
      CRISPR-Cas system gave us the "nerves" to "talk" to our nerves with ease.

AB  - The ability to artificially control transcription is essential both to the study of 
      gene function and to the construction of synthetic gene networks with desired 
      properties. Cas9 is an RNA-guided double-stranded DNA nuclease that participates in 
      the CRISPR-Cas immune defense against prokaryotic viruses. We describe the use of a 
      Cas9 nuclease mutant that retains DNA-binding activity and can be engineered as a 
      programmable transcription repressor by preventing the binding of the RNA polymerase 
      (RNAP) to promoter sequences or as a transcription terminator by blocking the 
      running RNAP. In addition, a fusion between the omega subunit of the RNAP and a Cas9 
      nuclease mutant directed to bind upstream promoter regions can achieve programmable 
      transcription activation. The simple and efficient modulation of gene expression 
      achieved by this technology is a useful asset for the study of gene networks and for 
      the development of synthetic biology and biotechnological applications.

AB  - The term 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats' (CRISPR) has 
      recently become synonymous with the genome-editing revolution. The RNA-guided 
      endonuclease CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), in particular, has attracted 
      attention for its promise in basic research and gene editing-based therapeutics. 
      CRISPR-Cas systems are efficient and easily programmable nucleic acid-targeting 
      tools, with uses reaching beyond research and therapeutic development into the 
      precision breeding of plants and animals and the engineering of industrial microbes. 
      CRISPR-Cas systems have potential for many microbial engineering applications, 
      including bacterial strain typing, immunization of cultures, autoimmunity or 
      self-targeted cell killing, and the engineering or control of metabolic pathways for 
      improved biochemical synthesis. In this review, we explore the fundamental 
      characteristics of CRISPR-Cas systems and highlight how these features can be used 
      in industrial settings.

AB  - RNA-based regulation and CRISPR/Cas transcription factors (CRISPR-TFs) have the 
      potential to be integrated for the tunable modulation of gene networks. A major 
      limitation of this methodology is that guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-TFs can only be 
      expressed from RNA polymerase III promoters in human cells, limiting their use for 
      conditional gene regulation. We present new strategies that enable expression of 
      functional gRNAs from RNA polymerase II promoters and multiplexed production of 
      proteins and gRNAs from a single transcript in human cells. We use multiple RNA 
      regulatory strategies, including RNA-triple-helix structures, introns, microRNAs, 
      and ribozymes, with Cas9-based CRISPR-TFs and Cas6/Csy4-based RNA processing. Using 
      these tools, we efficiently modulate endogenous promoters and implement tunable 
      synthetic circuits, including multistage cascades and RNA-dependent networks that 
      can be rewired with Csy4 to achieve complex behaviors. This toolkit can be used for 
      programming scalable gene circuits and perturbing endogenous networks for biology, 
      therapeutic, and synthetic biology applications.

AB  - The CRISPR-Cas system has rapidly reached a huge popularity as a new, powerful 
      method for precise DNA editing and genome reengineering. In Synthetic Biology, the 
      CRISPR-Cas type II system has inspired the construction of a novel class of 
      RNA-based transcription factors. In their simplest form, they are made of a CRISPR 
      RNA molecule, which targets a promoter sequence, and a deficient Cas9 (i.e. deprived 
      of any nuclease activity) that has been fused to an activation or a repression 
      domain. Up- and downregulation of single genes in mammalian and yeast cells have 
      been achieved with satisfactory results. Moreover, the construction of CRISPR-based 
      transcription factors is much simpler than the assembly of synthetic proteins such 
      as the Transcription Activator-Like effectors. However, the feasibility of complex 
      synthetic networks fully based on the CRISPR-dCas9 technology has still to be proved 
      and new designs, which take into account different CRISPR types, shall be 
      investigated.

TI  - CC-90009, a novel cereblon E3 ligase modulator, targets acute myeloid leukemia 
      blasts and leukemia stem cells.
PG  - 661-677
LID - 10.1182/blood.2020008676 [doi]
AB  - A number of clinically validated drugs have been developed by repurposing the 
      CUL4-DDB1-CRBN-RBX1 (CRL4CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with molecular glue 
      degraders to eliminate disease-driving proteins. Here, we present the identification 
      of a first-in-class GSPT1-selective cereblon E3 ligase modulator, CC-90009. 
      Biochemical, structural, and molecular characterization demonstrates that CC-90009 
      coopts the CRL4CRBN to selectively target GSPT1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal 
      degradation. Depletion of GSPT1 by CC-90009 rapidly induces acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML) apoptosis, reducing leukemia engraftment and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in 
      large-scale primary patient xenografting of 35 independent AML samples, including 
      those with adverse risk features. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for 
      effectors of CC-90009 response, we uncovered the ILF2 and ILF3 heterodimeric complex 
      as a novel regulator of cereblon expression. Knockout of ILF2/ILF3 decreases the 
      production of full-length cereblon protein via modulating CRBN messenger RNA 
      alternative splicing, leading to diminished response to CC-90009. The screen also 
      revealed that the mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response specifically 
      regulate the response to CC-90009 in contrast to other cereblon modulators. 
      Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway by inactivation of TSC1 and TSC2 protected 
      against the growth inhibitory effect of CC-90009 by reducing CC-90009-induced 
      binding of GSPT1 to cereblon and subsequent GSPT1 degradation. On the other hand, 
      GSPT1 degradation promoted the activation of the GCN1/GCN2/ATF4 pathway and 
      subsequent apoptosis in AML cells. Collectively, CC-90009 activity is mediated by 
      multiple layers of signaling networks and pathways within AML blasts and LSCs, whose 
      elucidation gives insight into further assessment of CC-90009s clinical utility. 
      These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02848001 and 
      #NCT04336982).

TI  - Targeted Disruption of HLA Genes via CRISPR-Cas9 Generates iPSCs with Enhanced 
      Immune Compatibility.

AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have strong potential in regenerative 
      medicine applications; however, immune rejection caused by HLA mismatching is a 
      concern. B2M gene knockout and HLA-homozygous iPSC stocks can address this issue, 
      but the former approach may induce NK cell activity and fail to present antigens, 
      and it is challenging to recruit rare donors for the latter method. Here, we show 
      two genome-editing strategies for making immunocompatible donor iPSCs. First, we 
      generated HLA pseudo-homozygous iPSCs with allele-specific editing of HLA 
      heterozygous iPSCs. Second, we generated HLA-C-retained iPSCs by disrupting both 
      HLA-A and -B alleles to suppress the NK cell response while maintaining antigen 
      presentation. HLA-C-retained iPSCs could evade T cells and NK cells in vitro and 
      in vivo. We estimated that 12 lines of HLA-C-retained iPSCs combined with HLA-class 
      II knockout are immunologically compatible with >90% of the world's population, 
      greatly facilitating iPSC-based regenerative medicine applications.

TI  - Image-based pooled whole-genome CRISPRi screening for subcellular phenotypes.
LID - 10.1083/jcb.202006180 [doi]
LID - e202006180
AB  - Genome-wide CRISPR screens have transformed our ability to systematically 
      interrogate human gene function, but are currently limited to a subset of cellular 
      phenotypes. We report a novel pooled screening approach for a wider range of 
      cellular and subtle subcellular phenotypes. Machine learning and convolutional 
      neural network models are trained on the subcellular phenotype to be queried. 
      Genome-wide screening then utilizes cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi), 
      photoactivatable fluorescent protein (PA-mCherry), and a lentiviral guide RNA (gRNA) 
      pool. Cells are screened by using microscopy and classified by artificial 
      intelligence (AI) algorithms, which precisely identify the genetically altered 
      phenotype. Cells with the phenotype of interest are photoactivated and isolated via 
      flow cytometry, and the gRNAs are identified by sequencing. A proof-of-concept 
      screen accurately identified PINK1 as essential for Parkin recruitment to 
      mitochondria. A genome-wide screen identified factors mediating TFEB relocation from 
      the nucleus to the cytosol upon prolonged starvation. Twenty-one of the 64 hits 
      called by the neural network model were independently validated, revealing new 
      effectors of TFEB subcellular localization. This approach, AI-photoswitchable 
      screening (AI-PS), offers a novel screening platform capable of classifying a broad 
      range of mammalian subcellular morphologies, an approach largely unattainable with 
      current methodologies at genome-wide scale.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genome engineering by facilitating a wide 
      range of targeted DNA perturbations. These systems have resulted in new powerful 
      screens to test gene functions at the genomic scale. While there is tremendous 
      potential for CRISPR screens to map and interrogate gene regulatory networks at 
      unprecedented speed and scale, their implementation in plants remains in its 
      infancy. Here we discuss the general concepts, tools and workflows for establishing 
      CRISPR screens in plants and analyze the handful of recent reports using this 
      strategy to generate mutant knockout collections or diversify DNA sequences. In 
      addition, we provide insight on how to design CRISPR knockout screens in plants 
      given the current challenges and limitations and examine multiple design options. 
      Finally, we discuss the unique multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR screens to 
      investigate redundant gene function in highly duplicated plant genomes. 
      Combinatorial mutant screens have the potential to routinely generate higher-order 
      mutant collections and facilitate the characterization of gene networks. By 
      integrating this approach with the large resource of genomic profiles that were 
      generated in the last two decades, the implementation of CRISPR screens offers new 
      opportunities to analyze plant genomes at deeper resolution and will greatly advance 
      plant functional and synthetic biology.

TI  - Clades of huge phages from across Earth's ecosystems.
PG  - 425-431
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2007-4 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages typically have small genomes(1) and depend on their bacterial hosts 
      for replication(2). Here we sequenced DNA from diverse ecosystems and found hundreds 
      of phage genomes with lengths of more than 200 kilobases (kb), including a genome of 
      735 kb, which is-to our knowledge-the largest phage genome to be described to date. 
      Thirty-five genomes were manually curated to completion (circular and no gaps). 
      Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and previously undescribed CRISPR-Cas 
      systems, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), tRNA synthetases, tRNA-modification enzymes, 
      translation-initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. The 
      CRISPR-Cas systems of phages have the capacity to silence host transcription factors 
      and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that 
      intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In 
      addition, some phages may repurpose bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems to eliminate 
      competing phages. We phylogenetically define the major clades of huge phages from 
      human and other animal microbiomes, as well as from oceans, lakes, sediments, soils 
      and the built environment. We conclude that the large gene inventories of huge 
      phages reflect a conserved biological strategy, and that the phages are distributed 
      across a broad bacterial host range and across Earth's ecosystems.

AB  - Cas13 has demonstrated unique and broad utility in RNA editing, nucleic acid 
      detection, and disease diagnosis; however, a constantly active Cas enzyme may induce 
      unwanted effects. Bacteriophage- or prophage-region-encoded anti-CRISPR (acr) gene 
      molecules provide the potential to control targeting specificity and potency to 
      allow for optimal RNA editing and nucleic acid detection by spatiotemporally 
      modulating endonuclease activities. Using integrated approaches to screen acrVI 
      candidates and evaluate their effects on Cas13 function, we discovered a series of 
      acrVIA1-7 genes that block the activities of Cas13a. These VI-A CRISPR inhibitors 
      substantially attenuate RNA targeting and editing by Cas13a in human cells. 
      Strikingly, type VI-A anti-CRISPRs (AcrVIAs) also significantly muffle the 
      single-nucleic-acid editing ability of the dCas13a RNA-editing system. 
      Mechanistically, AcrVIA1, -4, -5, and -6 bind LwaCas13a, while AcrVIA2 and -3 can 
      only bind the LwaCas13-crRNA (CRISPR RNA) complex. These identified acr molecules 
      may enable precise RNA editing in Cas13-based application and study of 
      phage-bacterium interaction.

LID - e00752-19
AB  - A diversity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas 
      systems provide adaptive immunity to bacteria and archaea through recording 
      "memories" of past viral infections. Recently, many novel CRISPR-associated proteins 
      have been discovered via computational studies, but those studies relied on biased 
      and incomplete databases of assembled genomes. We avoided these biases and applied a 
      network theory approach to search for novel CRISPR-associated genes by leveraging 
      subtle ecological cooccurrence patterns identified from environmental metagenomes. 
      We validated our method using existing annotations and discovered 32 novel 
      CRISPR-associated gene families. These genes span a range of putative functions, 
      with many potentially regulating the response to infection.IMPORTANCE Every branch 
      on the tree of life, including microbial life, faces the threat of viral pathogens. 
      Over the course of billions of years of coevolution, prokaryotes have evolved a 
      great diversity of strategies to defend against viral infections. One of these is 
      the CRISPR adaptive immune system, which allows microbes to "remember" past 
      infections in order to better fight them in the future. There has been much interest 
      among molecular biologists in CRISPR immunity because this system can be repurposed 
      as a tool for precise genome editing. Recently, a number of comparative genomics 
      approaches have been used to detect novel CRISPR-associated genes in databases of 
      genomes with great success, potentially leading to the development of new 
      genome-editing tools. Here, we developed novel methods to search for these distinct 
      classes of genes directly in environmental samples ("metagenomes"), thus capturing a 
      more complete picture of the natural diversity of CRISPR-associated genes.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas is a powerful genome editing technology and has a great potential for in 
      vivo gene therapy. Successful translational application of CRISPR-Cas to biomedicine 
      still faces many safety concerns, including off-target side effect, cell fitness 
      problem after CRISPR-Cas treatment, and on-target genome editing side effect in 
      undesired tissues. To solve these issues, it is needed to design sgRNA with high 
      cell-specific efficacy and specificity. Existing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design 
      tools mainly depend on a sgRNA sequence and the local information of the targeted 
      genome, thus are not sufficient to account for the difference in the cellular 
      response of the same gene in different cell types. To incorporate cell-specific 
      information into the sgRNA design, we develop novel interpretable machine learning 
      models, which integrate features learned from advanced transformer-based deep neural 
      network with cell-specific gene property derived from biological network and gene 
      expression profile, for the prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas12a efficacy and 
      specificity. In benchmark studies, our models significantly outperform 
      state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, we find that the network-based gene 
      property is critical for the prediction of cell-specific post-treatment cellular 
      response. Our results suggest that the design of efficient and safe CRISPR-Cas needs 
      to consider cell-specific information of genes. Our findings may bolster developing 
      more accurate predictive models of CRISPR-Cas across a broad spectrum of biological 
      conditions as well as provide new insight into developing efficient and safe 
      CRISPR-based gene therapy.

AB  - Human regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for immune homeostasis. The 
      transcription factor FOXP3 maintains T(reg) cell identity, yet the complete set of 
      key transcription factors that control T(reg) cell gene expression remains unknown. 
      Here, we used pooled and arrayed Cas9 ribonucleoprotein screens to identify 
      transcription factors that regulate critical proteins in primary human T(reg) cells 
      under basal and proinflammatory conditions. We then generated 54,424 single-cell 
      transcriptomes from T(reg) cells subjected to genetic perturbations and cytokine 
      stimulation, which revealed distinct gene networks individually regulated by FOXP3 
      and PRDM1, in addition to a network coregulated by FOXO1 and IRF4. We also 
      discovered that HIVEP2, to our knowledge not previously implicated in T(reg) cell 
      function, coregulates another gene network with SATB1 and is important for T(reg) 
      cell-mediated immunosuppression. By integrating CRISPR screens and single-cell 
      RNA-sequencing profiling, we have uncovered transcriptional regulators and 
      downstream gene networks in human T(reg) cells that could be targeted for 
      immunotherapies.

AB  - Over one million candidate regulatory elements have been identified across the human 
      genome, but nearly all are unvalidated and their target genes uncertain. Approaches 
      based on human genetics are limited in scope to common variants and in resolution by 
      linkage disequilibrium. We present a multiplex, expression quantitative trait locus 
      (eQTL)-inspired framework for mapping enhancer-gene pairs by introducing random 
      combinations of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated perturbations to each of many cells, followed 
      by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Across two experiments, we used dCas9-KRAB 
      to perturb 5,920 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their 
      target gene(s), measuring effects by profiling 254,974 single-cell transcriptomes. 
      We identified 664 (470 high-confidence) cis enhancer-gene pairs, which were enriched 
      for specific transcription factors, non-housekeeping status, and genomic and 3D 
      conformational proximity to their target genes. This framework will facilitate the 
      large-scale mapping of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions, a critical yet largely 
      uncharted component of the cis-regulatory landscape of the human genome.

PG  - 2701-2722

AB  - Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex plastic and reversible 
      cellular process that has critical roles in diverse physiological and pathological 
      phenomena. EMT is involved in embryonic development, organogenesis and tissue 
      repair, as well as in fibrosis, cancer metastasis and drug resistance. In recent 
      years, the ability to edit the genome using the clustered regularly interspaced 
      palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) system has greatly 
      contributed to identify or validate critical genes in pathway signaling. This review 
      delineates the complex EMT networks and discusses recent studies that have used 
      CRISPR/Cas technology to further advance our understanding of the EMT process.

AB  - T helper type 2 (Th2) cells are important regulators of mammalian adaptive immunity 
      and have relevance for infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immunology. Using a newly 
      developed, genome-wide retroviral CRISPR knockout (KO) library, combined with 
      RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq, we have dissected the regulatory circuitry 
      governing activation and differentiation of these cells. Our experiments distinguish 
      cell activation versus differentiation in a quantitative framework. We demonstrate 
      that these two processes are tightly coupled and are jointly controlled by many 
      transcription factors, metabolic genes, and cytokine/receptor pairs. There are only 
      a small number of genes regulating differentiation without any role in activation. 
      By combining biochemical and genetic data, we provide an atlas for Th2 
      differentiation, validating known regulators and identifying factors, such as Pparg 
      and Bhlhe40, as part of the core regulatory network governing Th2 helper cell fates.

AB  - One of the biggest threats we face globally is the emergence of 
      antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria, which runs in parallel with the lack in the 
      development of new antimicrobials. Among these AMR bacteria pathogens belonging to 
      the ESKAPE group can be highlighted (Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
      Enterobacter spp.) due to their profile of drug resistance and virulence. Therefore, 
      innovative lines of treatment must be developed for these bacteria. In this review, 
      we summarize the different strategies for the treatment and study of molecular 
      mechanisms of AMR in the ESKAPE pathogens based on the clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins' 
      technologies: loss of plasmid or cellular viability, random mutation or gene 
      deletion as well directed mutations that lead to a gene's loss of function.

PG  - 755-60
LID - 10.1038/nbt.3245 [doi]
AB  - We describe an engineered photoactivatable Cas9 (paCas9) that enables optogenetic 
      control of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in human cells. paCas9 consists of split Cas9 
      fragments and photoinducible dimerization domains named Magnets. In response to blue 
      light irradiation, paCas9 expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells induces 
      targeted genome sequence modifications through both nonhomologous end joining and 
      homology-directed repair pathways. Genome editing activity can be switched off 
      simply by extinguishing the light. We also demonstrate activation of paCas9 in 
      spatial patterns determined by the sites of irradiation. Optogenetic control of 
      targeted genome editing should facilitate improved understanding of complex gene 
      networks and could prove useful in biomedical applications.

TI  - Ca(2+) sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a 
      fungal effector.

AB  - Plant immunity is activated upon pathogen perception and often affects growth and 
      yield when it is constitutively active. How plants fine-tune immune homeostasis in 
      their natural habitats remains elusive. Here, we discover a conserved immune 
      suppression network in cereals that orchestrates immune homeostasis, centering on a 
      Ca(2+)-sensor, RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1 (ROD1). ROD1 promotes reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity, and its protein stability 
      is regulated by ubiquitination. ROD1 disruption confers resistance to multiple 
      pathogens, whereas a natural ROD1 allele prevalent in indica rice with 
      agroecology-specific distribution enhances resistance without yield penalty. The 
      fungal effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and activates the same 
      ROS-scavenging cascade to suppress host immunity and promote virulence. We thus 
      reveal a molecular framework adopted by both host and pathogen that integrates 
      Ca(2+) sensing and ROS homeostasis to suppress plant immunity, suggesting a 
      principle for breeding disease-resistant, high-yield crops.

      bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, control the expression of genes encoding 
      virulence factors or metabolic proteins. They are extremely diverse and include 
      noncoding RNAs (sRNA), antisense RNAs, and some 5' or 3' untranslated regions of 
      messenger RNAs that act as sensors for metabolites, tRNAs, or environmental 
      conditions (e.g., temperature, pH). In this review we focus on specific examples of 
      sRNAs of S. aureus that illustrate how numerous sRNAs and associated proteins are 
      embedded in complex networks of regulation. In addition, we discuss the CRISPR-Cas 
      systems defined as an RNA-interference-like mechanism, which also exist in 
      staphylococcal strains.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a devastating disease in need of new therapies 
      to improve patient survival. Targeted adoptive T-cell therapies have achieved 
      impressive clinical outcomes in some B-cell leukemias and lymphomas but not in AML. 
      Double-negative T cells (DNTs) effectively kill blast cells from the majority of AML 
      patients and are now being tested in clinical trials. However, AML blasts obtained 
      from ∼30% of patients show resistance to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity; the markers or 
      mechanisms underlying this resistance have not been elucidated. Here, we used a 
      targeted clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) screen to identify genes that cause 
      susceptibility of AML cells to DNT therapy. Inactivation of the 
      Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) deubiquitinating complex components sensitized 
      AML cells to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, CD64 inactivation resulted in 
      resistance to DNT-mediated cytotoxicity. Importantly, the level of CD64 expression 
      correlated strongly with the sensitivity of AML cells to DNT treatment. Furthermore, 
      the ectopic expression of CD64 overcame AML resistance to DNTs in vitro and in vivo. 
      Altogether, our data demonstrate the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 screens to uncover 
      mechanisms underlying the sensitivity to DNT therapy and suggest CD64 as a 
      predictive marker for response in AML patients.

TI  - Orthologous CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes for combinatorial genetic screens.
PG  - 179-189
LID - 10.1038/nbt.4048 [doi]
AB  - Combinatorial genetic screening using CRISPR-Cas9 is a useful approach to uncover 
      redundant genes and to explore complex gene networks. However, current methods 
      suffer from interference between the single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and from limited 
      gene targeting activity. To increase the efficiency of combinatorial screening, we 
      employ orthogonal Cas9 enzymes from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus 
      pyogenes. We used machine learning to establish S. aureus Cas9 sgRNA design rules 
      and paired S. aureus Cas9 with S. pyogenes Cas9 to achieve dual targeting in a high 
      fraction of cells. We also developed a lentiviral vector and cloning strategy to 
      generate high-complexity pooled dual-knockout libraries to identify synthetic lethal 
      and buffering gene pairs across multiple cell types, including MAPK pathway genes 
      and apoptotic genes. Our orthologous approach also enabled a screen combining gene 
      knockouts with transcriptional activation, which revealed genetic interactions with 
      TP53. The "Big Papi" (paired aureus and pyogenes for interactions) approach 
      described here will be widely applicable for the study of combinatorial phenotypes.

AB  - Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a pivotal role in suppressing auto-reactive T cells 
      and maintaining immune homeostasis. Treg cell development and function are dependent 
      on the transcription factor Foxp3. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR 
      loss-of-function screen to identify Foxp3 regulators in mouse primary Treg cells. 
      Foxp3 regulators were enriched in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF 
      nucleosome-remodeling and SAGA chromatin-modifying complexes. Among the three 
      SWI/SNF-related complexes, the Brd9-containing non-canonical (nc) BAF complex 
      promoted Foxp3 expression, whereas the PBAF complex was repressive. Chemical-induced 
      degradation of Brd9 led to reduced Foxp3 expression and reduced Treg cell function 
      in vitro. Brd9 ablation compromised Treg cell function in inflammatory disease and 
      tumor immunity in vivo. Furthermore, Brd9 promoted Foxp3 binding and expression of a 
      subset of Foxp3 target genes. Our findings provide an unbiased analysis of the 
      genetic networks regulating Foxp3 and reveal ncBAF as a target for therapeutic 
      manipulation of Treg cell function.

TI  - Network-Based Combinatorial CRISPR-Cas9 Screens Identify Synergistic Modules in 
      Human Cells.
PG  - 482-490
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.8b00237 [doi]
AB  - Tumorigenesis is a complex process that is driven by a combination of networks of 
      genes and environmental factors; however, efficient approaches to identifying 
      functional networks that are perturbed by the process of tumorigenesis are lacking. 
      In this study, we provide a comprehensive network-based strategy for the systematic 
      discovery of functional synergistic modules that are causal determinants of 
      inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. Our approach prioritizes candidate genes 
      selected by integrating clinical-based and network-based genome-wide gene prediction 
      methods and identifies functional synergistic modules based on combinatorial 
      CRISPR-Cas9 screening. On the basis of candidate genes inferred de novo from 
      experimental and computational methods to be involved in inflammation and cancer, we 
      used an existing TGFβ1-induced cellular transformation model in colonic epithelial 
      cells and a new combinatorial CRISPR-Cas9 screening strategy to construct an 
      inflammation-induced differential genetic interaction network. The 
      inflammation-induced differential genetic interaction network that we generated 
      yielded functional insights into the genes and functional module combinations, and 
      showed varied responses to the inflammation agents as well as active traditional 
      Chinese medicine compounds. We identified opposing differential genetic interactions 
      of inflammation-induced tumorigenesis: synergistic promotion and suppression. The 
      synergistic promotion state was primarily caused by deletions in the immune and 
      metabolism modules; the synergistic suppression state was primarily induced by 
      deletions in the proliferation and immune modules or in the proliferation and 
      metabolism modules. These results provide insight into possible early combinational 
      targets and biomarkers for inflammation-induced tumorigenesis and highlight the 
      synergistic effects that occur among immune, proliferation, and metabolism modules. 
      In conclusion, this approach deepens the understanding of the underlying mechanisms 
      that cause inflammation to potentially increase the cancer risk of colonic 
      epithelial cells and accelerate the translation into novel functional modules or 
      synergistic module combinations that modulate complex disease phenotypes.

AB  - Despite rapid progresses in the genome-editing field, in vivo simultaneous 
      overexpression of multiple genes remains challenging. We generated a transgenic 
      mouse using an improved dCas9 system that enables simultaneous and precise in vivo 
      transcriptional activation of multiple genes and long noncoding RNAs in the nervous 
      system. As proof of concept, we were able to use targeted activation of endogenous 
      neurogenic genes in these transgenic mice to directly and efficiently convert 
      astrocytes into functional neurons in vivo. This system provides a flexible and 
      rapid screening platform for studying complex gene networks and gain-of-function 
      phenotypes in the mammalian brain.

AB  - As a heritable sequence-specific adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas is a powerful 
      force shaping strain diversity in host-virus systems. While the diversity of CRISPR 
      alleles has been explored, the associated structure and dynamics of host-virus 
      interactions have not. We explore the role of CRISPR in mediating the interplay 
      between host-virus interaction structure and eco-evolutionary dynamics in a 
      computational model and compare the results with three empirical datasets from 
      natural systems. We show that the structure of the networks describing who infects 
      whom and the degree to which strains are immune, are respectively modular 
      (containing groups of hosts and viruses that interact strongly) and weighted-nested 
      (specialist hosts are more susceptible to subsets of viruses that in turn also 
      infect the more generalist hosts with many spacers matching many viruses). The 
      dynamic interplay between these networks influences transitions between dynamical 
      regimes of virus diversification and host control. The three empirical systems 
      exhibit weighted-nested immunity networks, a pattern our theory shows is indicative 
      of hosts able to suppress virus diversification. Previously missing from studies of 
      microbial host-pathogen systems, the immunity network plays a key role in the 
      coevolutionary dynamics.

AB  - A highly effective metabolic pathway is the key for an efficient cell factory. 
      However, the engineered homologous or heterologous multi-gene pathway may be 
      unbalanced, inefficient and causing the accumulation of potentially toxic 
      intermediates. Therefore, pathways must be constructed optimally to minimize these 
      negative effects and maximize catalytic efficiency. With the development of CRISPR 
      technology, some of the problems of previous pathway engineering and genome editing 
      techniques were resolved, providing higher efficiency, lower cost, and easily 
      customizable targets. Moreover, CRISPR was demonstrated as robust and effective in 
      various organisms including both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In recent years, 
      researchers in the field of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have 
      exploited various CRISPR-based pathway engineering approaches, which are both 
      effective and convenient, as well as valuable from a theoretical standpoint. In this 
      review, we systematically summarize novel pathway engineering techniques and 
      strategies based on CRISPR nucleases system, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), and 
      CRISPR activation (CRISPRa), including figures and descriptions for easy 
      understanding, with the aim to facilitate their broader application among fellow 
      researchers.

TI  - Synthetic CRISPR-Cas gene activators for transcriptional reprogramming in bacteria.
PG  - 2489

LID - 2489
AB  - Methods to regulate gene expression programs in bacterial cells are limited by the 
      absence of effective gene activators. To address this challenge, we have developed 
      synthetic bacterial transcriptional activators in E. coli by linking activation 
      domains to programmable CRISPR-Cas DNA binding domains. Effective gene activation 
      requires target sites situated in a narrow region just upstream of the transcription 
      start site, in sharp contrast to the relatively flexible target site requirements 
      for gene activation in eukaryotic cells. Together with existing tools for CRISPRi 
      gene repression, these bacterial activators enable programmable control over 
      multiple genes with simultaneous activation and repression. Further, the entire gene 
      expression program can be switched on by inducing expression of the CRISPR-Cas 
      system. This work will provide a foundation for engineering synthetic bacterial 
      cellular devices with applications including diagnostics, therapeutics, and 
      industrial biosynthesis.

AB  - In metabolic engineering, genome editing tools make it much easier to discover and 
      evaluate relevant genes and pathways and construct strains. Clustered regularly 
      interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) systems now have become 
      the first choice for genome engineering in many organisms includingindustrially 
      relevant ones. Targeted DNA cleavage by CRISPR-Cas provides variousgenome 
      engineering modes such as indels, replacements, large deletions, knock-in and 
      chromosomal rearrangements, while host-dependent differences in repair pathways need 
      to be considered. The versatility of the CRISPR system has given rise to derivative 
      technologies that complement nuclease-based editing, which causes cytotoxicity 
      especially in microorganisms. Deaminase-mediated base editing installs targeted 
      point mutations with much less toxicity. CRISPRi and CRISPRa can temporarily control 
      gene expression without changing the genomic sequence. Multiplex, combinatorial and 
      large scale editing are made possible by streamlined design and construction of gRNA 
      libraries to further accelerates comprehensive discovery, evaluation and building of 
      metabolic pathways. This review summarizes the technical basis and recent advances 
      in CRISPR-related genome editing tools applied for metabolic engineering purposes, 
      with representative examples of industrially relevant eukaryotic and prokaryotic 
      organisms.

AB  - The well-designed microbial cell factory finds wide applications in chemical, 
      pharmaceutical, and food industries due to its sustainable and environmentally 
      friendly features. Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) systems have been 
      developed into powerful tools to perform genome editing and transcriptional 
      regulation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Accordingly, these tools are useful 
      to build microbial cell factories not only by reconstructing the genome but also by 
      reprogramming the metabolic network. In this review, we summarize the recent 
      significant headway and potential uses of the CRISPR technology in the construction 
      of efficient microbial cell factories. Moreover, the future perspectives on the 
      improvement and upgradation of CRISPR-based tools are also discussed.

AB  - The ability to modify multiple genetic elements simultaneously would help to 
      elucidate and control the gene interactions and networks underlying complex cellular 
      functions. However, current genome engineering technologies are limited in both the 
      number and the type of perturbations that can be performed simultaneously. Here, we 
      demonstrate that both Cas12a and a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeat (CRISPR) array can be encoded in a single transcript by adding a stabilizer 
      tertiary RNA structure. By leveraging this system, we illustrate constitutive, 
      conditional, inducible, orthogonal and multiplexed genome engineering of endogenous 
      targets using up to 25 individual CRISPR RNAs delivered on a single plasmid. Our 
      method provides a powerful platform to investigate and orchestrate the sophisticated 
      genetic programs underlying complex cell behaviors.

AB  - Gene expression in mammals is regulated by noncoding elements that can affect 
      physiology and disease, yet the functions and target genes of most noncoding 
      elements remain unknown. We present a high-throughput approach that uses clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) to 
      discover regulatory elements and identify their target genes. We assess >1 megabase 
      of sequence in the vicinity of two essential transcription factors, MYC and GATA1, 
      and identify nine distal enhancers that control gene expression and cellular 
      proliferation. Quantitative features of chromatin state and chromosome conformation 
      distinguish the seven enhancers that regulate MYC from other elements that do not, 
      suggesting a strategy for predicting enhancer-promoter connectivity. This 
      CRISPRi-based approach can be applied to dissect transcriptional networks and 
      interpret the contributions of noncoding genetic variation to human disease.

AB  - The human genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), even 
      outnumbering protein-coding genes. These molecules can play a pivotal role in the 
      development and progression of human disease, including cancer, and are susceptible 
      to therapeutic intervention. Evidence of biologic function, however, is still 
      missing for the vast majority of them. Both loss-of-function (LOF) and 
      gain-of-function (GOF) studies are therefore necessary to advance our understanding 
      of lncRNA networks and programs driving tumorigenesis. Here, we describe a protocol 
      to perform lncRNA's LOF or GOF studies in multiple myeloma (MM) cells, using CRISPR 
      interference (CRISPRi) or CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) technologies, respectively. 
      These approaches have many advantages, including applicability to large-scale 
      genetic screens in mammalian cells and possible reversibility of modulating effects; 
      moreover, CRISPRa offers the unique opportunity to enhance lncRNA expression at the 
      site of transcription, with relevant biologic implications.

AB  - The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats associated Cas9/sgRNA 
      system is a novel targeted genome-editing technique derived from bacterial immune 
      system. It is an inexpensive, easy, most user friendly and rapidly adopted genome 
      editing tool transforming to revolutionary paradigm. This technique enables precise 
      genomic modifications in many different organisms and tissues. Cas9 protein is an 
      RNA guided endonuclease utilized for creating targeted double-stranded breaks with 
      only a short RNA sequence to confer recognition of the target in animals and plants. 
      Development of genetically edited (GE) crops similar to those developed by 
      conventional or mutation breeding using this potential technique makes it a 
      promising and extremely versatile tool for providing sustainable productive 
      agriculture for better feeding of rapidly growing population in a changing climate. 
      The emerging areas of research for the genome editing in plants include 
      interrogating gene function, rewiring the regulatory signaling networks and sgRNA 
      library for high-throughput loss-of-function screening. In this review, we have 
      described the broad applicability of the Cas9 nuclease mediated targeted plant 
      genome editing for development of designer crops. The regulatory uncertainty and 
      social acceptance of plant breeding by Cas9 genome editing have also been described. 
      With this powerful and innovative technique the designer GE non-GM plants could 
      further advance climate resilient and sustainable agriculture in the future and 
      maximizing yield by combating abiotic and biotic stresses.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also known as multipotent mesenchymal stromal stem 
      cells, are found in the perivascular space of several tissues. These cells have been 
      subject of intense research in the last decade due to their low teratogenicity, as 
      well as their ability to differentiate into mature cells and to secrete 
      immunomodulatory and trophic factors. However, they usually promote only a modest 
      benefit when transplanted in experimental disease models, one of the limitations for 
      their clinical application. The CRISPR-Cas system, in turn, is highlighted as a 
      simple and effective tool for genetic engineering. This system was tested in 
      clinical trials over a relatively short period of time after establishing its 
      applicability to the edition of the mammalian cell genome. Similar to the research 
      evolution in MSCs, the CRISPR-Cas system demonstrated inconsistencies that limited 
      its clinical application. In this review, we outline the evolution of MSC research 
      and its applicability, and the progress of the CRISPR-Cas system from its discovery 
      to the most recent clinical trials. We also propose perspectives on how the 
      CRISPR-Cas system may improve the therapeutic potential of MSCs, making it more 
      beneficial and long lasting.

      in human microbiomes.
PG  - R40
LID - 10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-r40 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and archaea develop immunity against invading genomes by 
      incorporating pieces of the invaders' sequences, called spacers, into a clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus between repeats, 
      forming arrays of repeat-spacer units. When spacers are expressed, they direct 
      CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to silence complementary invading DNA. In order to 
      characterize the invaders of human microbiomes, we use spacers from CRISPR arrays 
      that we had previously assembled from shotgun metagenomic datasets, and identify 
      contigs that contain these spacers' targets. RESULTS: We discover 95,000 contigs 
      that are putative invasive mobile genetic elements, some targeted by hundreds of 
      CRISPR spacers. We find that oral sites in healthy human populations have a much 
      greater variety of mobile genetic elements than stool samples. Mobile genetic 
      elements carry genes encoding diverse functions: only 7% of the mobile genetic 
      elements are similar to known phages or plasmids, although a much greater proportion 
      contain phage- or plasmid-related genes. A small number of contigs share similarity 
      with known integrative and conjugative elements, providing the first examples of 
      CRISPR defenses against this class of element. We provide detailed analyses of a few 
      large mobile genetic elements of various types, and a relative abundance analysis of 
      mobile genetic elements and putative hosts, exploring the dynamic activities of 
      mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes. A joint analysis of mobile genetic 
      elements and CRISPRs shows that protospacer-adjacent motifs drive their interaction 
      network; however, some CRISPR-Cas systems target mobile genetic elements lacking 
      motifs. CONCLUSIONS: We identify a large collection of invasive mobile genetic 
      elements in human microbiomes, an important resource for further study of the 
      interaction between the CRISPR-Cas immune system and invaders.

AB  - To identify novel targets for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy, we performed 
      genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening using AML cell lines, followed by a second screen 
      in vivo. Here, we show that the mRNA decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS) gene is 
      essential for AML cell survival. The DCPS enzyme interacted with components of 
      pre-mRNA metabolic pathways, including spliceosomes, as revealed by mass 
      spectrometry. RG3039, a DCPS inhibitor originally developed to treat spinal muscular 
      atrophy, exhibited anti-leukemic activity via inducing pre-mRNA mis-splicing. Humans 
      harboring germline biallelic DCPS loss-of-function mutations do not exhibit aberrant 
      hematologic phenotypes, indicating that DCPS is dispensable for human hematopoiesis. 
      Our findings shed light on a pre-mRNA metabolic pathway and identify DCPS as a 
      target for AML therapy.

AB  - Alternative splicing is crucial for diverse cellular, developmental, and 
      pathological processes. However, the full networks of factors that control 
      individual splicing events are not known. Here, we describe a CRISPR-based strategy 
      for the genome-wide elucidation of pathways that control splicing and apply it to 
      microexons with important functions in nervous system development and that are 
      commonly misregulated in autism. Approximately 200 genes associated with 
      functionally diverse regulatory layers and enriched in genetic links to autism 
      control neuronal microexons. Remarkably, the widely expressed RNA binding proteins 
      Srsf11 and Rnps1 directly, preferentially, and frequently co-activate these 
      microexons. These factors form critical interactions with the neuronal splicing 
      regulator Srrm4 and a bi-partite intronic splicing enhancer element to promote 
      spliceosome formation. Our study thus presents a versatile system for the 
      identification of entire splicing regulatory pathways and further reveals a common 
      mechanism for the definition of neuronal microexons that is disrupted in autism.

TI  - Bcl-6 is the nexus transcription factor of T follicular helper cells via 
      repressor-of-repressor circuits.
PG  - 777-789
LID - 10.1038/s41590-020-0706-5 [doi]
AB  - T follicular helper (T(FH)) cells are a distinct type of CD4(+) T cells that are 
      essential for most antibody and B lymphocyte responses. T(FH) cell regulation and 
      dysregulation is involved in a range of diseases. Bcl-6 is the lineage-defining 
      transcription factor of T(FH) cells and its activity is essential for T(FH) cell 
      differentiation and function. However, how Bcl-6 controls T(FH) biology has largely 
      remained unclear, at least in part due to the intrinsic challenges of connecting 
      repressors to gene upregulation in complex cell types with multiple possible 
      differentiation fates. Multiple competing models were tested here by a series of 
      experimental approaches to determine that Bcl-6 exhibits negative autoregulation and 
      controls pleiotropic attributes of T(FH) differentiation and function, including 
      migration, costimulation, inhibitory receptors and cytokines, via multiple 
      repressor-of-repressor gene circuits.

TI  - Optimization of therapeutic antibodies by predicting antigen specificity from 
      antibody sequence via deep learning.
PG  - 600-612
LID - 10.1038/s41551-021-00699-9 [doi]
AB  - The optimization of therapeutic antibodies is time-intensive and resource-demanding, 
      largely because of the low-throughput screening of full-length antibodies 
      (approximately 1 × 10(3) variants) expressed in mammalian cells, which typically 
      results in few optimized leads. Here we show that optimized antibody variants can be 
      identified by predicting antigen specificity via deep learning from a massively 
      diverse space of antibody sequences. To produce data for training deep neural 
      networks, we deep-sequenced libraries of the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (about 
      1 × 10(4) variants), expressed in a mammalian cell line through site-directed 
      mutagenesis via CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair, and screened the 
      libraries for specificity to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). We 
      then used the trained neural networks to screen a computational library of 
      approximately 1 × 10(8) trastuzumab variants and predict the HER2-specific subset 
      (approximately 1 × 10(6) variants), which can then be filtered for viscosity, 
      clearance, solubility and immunogenicity to generate thousands of highly optimized 
      lead candidates. Recombinant expression and experimental testing of 30 randomly 
      selected variants from the unfiltered library showed that all 30 retained 
      specificity for HER2. Deep learning may facilitate antibody engineering and 
      optimization.

AB  - Reprogramming complex cellular metabolism requires simultaneous regulation of 
      multigene expression. Ex-situ cloning-based methods are commonly used, but the 
      target gene number and combinatorial library size are severely limited by cloning 
      and transformation efficiencies. In-situ methods such as multiplex automated genome 
      engineering (MAGE) depends on high-efficiency transformation and incorporation of 
      heterologous DNA donors, which are limited to few microorganisms. Here, we describe 
      a Base Editor-Targeted and Template-free Expression Regulation (BETTER) method for 
      simultaneously diversifying multigene expression. BETTER repurposes CRISPR-guided 
      base editors and in-situ generates large numbers of genetic combinations of diverse 
      ribosome binding sites, 5' untranslated regions, or promoters, without library 
      construction, transformation, and incorporation of DNA donors. We apply BETTER to 
      simultaneously regulate expression of up to ten genes in industrial and model 
      microorganisms Corynebacterium glutamicum and Bacillus subtilis. Variants with 
      improved xylose catabolism, glycerol catabolism, or lycopene biosynthesis are 
      respectively obtained. This technology will be useful for large-scale fine-tuning of 
      multigene expression in both genetically tractable and intractable microorganisms.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. BC 
      develops due to dysregulation of transcriptional profiles, substantial interpatient 
      variations, genetic mutations, and dysregulation of signaling pathways in breast 
      cells. These events are regulated by many genes such as BRCA1/2, PTEN, TP53, mTOR, 
      TERT, AKT, PI3K and others genes. Treatment options for BC remain a hurdle, which 
      warrants a comprehensive understanding that establishes an interlinking connection 
      between these genes in BC tumorigenesis. Consequently, there is an increasing demand 
      for alternative treatment approaches and the design of more effective treatments. In 
      this regard, it is crucial to build the corresponding transcriptional regulatory 
      networks governing BC by using advanced genetic tools and techniques. In the past, 
      several molecular editing technologies have been used to edit genes with several 
      limitations. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats 
      (CRISPR)/CRISPR Associated Protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) recently received wise attention 
      due to its potential in biomedical and therapeutic applications. Here, we review the 
      role of various molecular signalling pathways dysregulated in BC development such as 
      PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR as well as BRCA1/BRCA2/TP53/TERT and their interplay between the 
      related gene networks in BC initiation, progression and development of resistance 
      against available targeted therapeutic agents. Use of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing 
      technology to generate BC gene-specific transgenic cell lines and animal models to 
      decipher their role and interactions with other gene products has been employed 
      successfully. Moreover, the significance of using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to develop 
      early BC diagnostic tools and treatments is discussed here.

AB  - Without question, molecular biology drives modern neuroscience. The past 50 years 
      has been nothing short of revolutionary as key findings have moved the field from 
      correlation toward causation. Most obvious are the discoveries and strategies that 
      have been used to build tools for visualizing circuits, measuring activity, and 
      regulating behavior. Less flashy, but arguably as important are the myriad 
      investigations uncovering the actions of single molecules, macromolecular 
      structures, and integrated machines that serve as the basis for constructing 
      cellular and signaling pathways identified in wide-scale gene or RNA studies and for 
      feeding data into informational networks used in systems biology. This review 
      follows the pathways that were opened in neuroscience by major discoveries and set 
      the stage for the next 50 years.

TI  - Unexpected connections between type VI-B CRISPR-Cas systems, bacterial natural 
      competence, ubiquitin signaling network and DNA modification through a distinct 
      family of membrane proteins.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnz088 [doi]
LID - fnz088
AB  - In addition to core Cas proteins, CRISPR-Cas loci often encode ancillary proteins 
      that modulate the activity of the respective effectors in interference. Subtype 
      VI-B1 CRISPR-Cas systems encode the Csx27 protein that down-regulates the activity 
      of Cas13b when the type VI-B locus is expressed in Escherichia coli. We show that 
      Csx27 belongs to an expansive family of proteins that contain four predicted 
      transmembrane helices and are typically encoded in predicted operons with components 
      of the bacterial natural transformation machinery, multidomain proteins that consist 
      of components of the ubiquitin signaling system and proteins containing the 
      ligand-binding WYL domain and a helix-turn-helix domain. The Csx27 family proteins 
      are predicted to form membrane channels for ssDNA that might comprise the core of a 
      putative novel, Ub-regulated system for DNA uptake and, possibly, degradation. In 
      addition to these associations, a distinct subfamily of the Csx27 family appears to 
      be a part of a novel, membrane-associated system for DNA modification. In 
      Bacteroidetes, subtype VI-B1 systems might degrade nascent transcripts of foreign 
      DNA in conjunction with its uptake by the bacterial cell. These predictions suggest 
      several experimental directions for the study of type VI CRISPR-Cas systems and 
      distinct mechanisms of foreign DNA uptake and degradation in bacteria.

AB  - At the end of 2019, a new disease appeared and spread all over the world, the 
      COVID-19, produced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. As a consequence of this worldwide 
      health crisis, the scientific community began to redirect their knowledge and 
      resources to fight against it. Here we summarize the recent research on viruses 
      employed as therapy and diagnostic of COVID-19: (i) viral-vector vaccines both in 
      clinical trials and pre-clinical phases; (ii) the use of bacteriophages to find 
      antibodies specific to this virus and some studies of how to use the bacteriophages 
      themselves as a treatment against viral diseases; and finally, (iii) the use of 
      CRISPR-Cas technology both to obtain a fast precise diagnose of the patient and also 
      the possible use of this technology as a cure.

TI  - Using an Inducible CRISPR-dCas9-KRAB Effector System to Dissect Transcriptional 
      Regulation in Human Embryonic Stem Cells.
PG  - 221-233
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 effector systems have wide applications for the stem cell and 
      regenerative medicine field. The ability to dissect the functional gene regulatory 
      networks in pluripotency and potentially in differentiation intermediates of all 
      three germ layers makes this a valuable tool for the stem cell community. 
      Catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to transcriptional/chromatin effector domains 
      allows for silencing or activation of a genomic region of interest. Here, we 
      describe the application of an inducible, RNA-guided, nuclease-deficient (d) 
      Cas9-KRAB system (adapted from Streptococcus pyogenes) to silence target gene 
      expression in human embryonic stem cells, via KRAB repression at the promoter 
      region. This chapter outlines a detailed protocol for generation of a stable human 
      embryonic stem cell line containing both Sp-dCas9-KRAB and sgRNA, followed by 
      inducible expression of Sp-dCas9-KRAB to analyze functional effects of dCas9-KRAB at 
      target loci in human embryonic stem cells.

AB  - The dynamics of haematopoietic stem cell differentiation and the hierarchy of 
      oligopotent stem cells in the bone marrow remain controversial. Here we dissect 
      haematopoietic progenitor populations at single cell resolution, deriving an 
      unbiased reference model of transcriptional states in normal and perturbed murine 
      bone marrow. We define the signature of the naive haematopoietic stem cell and find 
      a continuum of core progenitor states. Core cell populations mix transcription of 
      pre-myeloid and pre-lymphoid programs, but do not mix erythroid or megakaryocyte 
      programs with other fates. CRISP-seq perturbation analysis confirms our models and 
      reveals that Cebpa regulates entry into all myeloid fates, while Irf8 and PU.1 
      deficiency block later differentiation towards monocyte or granulocyte fates. Our 
      transcriptional map defines a reference network model for blood progenitors and 
      their differentiation trajectories during normal and perturbed haematopoiesis.

TI  - Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge 
      yet Worth Accepting.
PG  - 1001

AB  - Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as versatile master regulator of biological 
      functions in recent years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous ncRNAs of 18-24 
      nucleotides in length that originates from long self-complementary precursors. 
      Besides their direct involvement in developmental processes, plant miRNAs play key 
      roles in gene regulatory networks and varied biological processes. Alternatively, 
      long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are a large and diverse class of transcribed ncRNAs whose 
      length exceed that of 200 nucleotides. Plant lncRNAs are transcribed by different 
      RNA polymerases, showing diverse structural features. Plant lncRNAs also are 
      important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological processes. There has 
      been a breakthrough in the technology of genome editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered 
      regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) 
      technology, in the last decade. CRISPR loci are transcribed into ncRNA and 
      eventually form a functional complex with Cas9 and further guide the complex to 
      cleave complementary invading DNA. The CRISPR-Cas technology has been successfully 
      applied in model plants such as Arabidopsis and tobacco and important crops like 
      wheat, maize, and rice. However, all these studies are focused on protein coding 
      genes. Information about targeting non-coding genes is scarce. Hitherto, the 
      CRISPR-Cas technology has been exclusively used in vertebrate systems to engineer 
      miRNA/lncRNAs, but it is still relatively unexplored in plants. While briefing 
      miRNAs, lncRNAs and applications of the CRISPR-Cas technology in human and animals, 
      this review essentially elaborates several strategies to overcome the challenges of 
      applying the CRISPR-Cas technology in editing ncRNAs in plants and the future 
      perspective of this field.

      CRISPR/Cas Experiments.

LID - 63
AB  - Computational tools are essential in the process of designing a CRISPR/Cas 
      experiment for the targeted modification of an organism's genome. Among other 
      functionalities, these tools facilitate the design of a guide-RNA (gRNA) for a given 
      nuclease that maximizes its binding to the intended genomic site, while avoiding 
      binding to undesired sites with similar sequences in the genome of the organism of 
      interest (off-targets). Due to the popularity of this methodology and the rapid pace 
      at which it evolves and changes, new computational tools show up constantly. This 
      rapid turnover, together with the intrinsic high death-rate of bioinformatics tools, 
      mean that many of the published tools become unavailable at some point. 
      Consequently, the traditional ways to inform the community about the landscape of 
      available tools, i.e., reviews in the scientific literature, are not adequate for 
      this fast-moving field. To overcome these limitations, we have developed "WeReview: 
      CRISPR Tools," a live, on-line, user-updatable repository of computational tools to 
      assist researchers in designing CRISPR/Cas experiments. In its web site users can 
      find an updated comprehensive list of tools and search for those fulfilling their 
      specific needs, as well as proposing modifications to the data associated with the 
      tools or the incorporation of new ones.

      human erythropoiesis.

AB  - Human erythropoiesis is an exquisitely controlled multistep developmental process, 
      and its dysregulation leads to numerous human diseases. Transcriptome and epigenome 
      studies provided insights into system-wide regulation, but we currently lack a 
      global mechanistic view on the dynamics of proteome and post-translational 
      regulation coordinating erythroid maturation. We established a mass spectrometry 
      (MS)-based proteomics workflow to quantify and dynamically track 7,400 proteins and 
      27,000 phosphorylation sites of five distinct maturation stages of in vitro 
      reconstituted erythropoiesis of CD34(+) HSPCs. Our data reveal developmental 
      regulation through drastic proteome remodeling across stages of erythroid maturation 
      encompassing most protein classes. This includes various orchestrated changes in 
      solute carriers indicating adjustments to altered metabolic requirements. To define 
      the distinct proteome of each maturation stage, we developed a computational 
      deconvolution approach which revealed stage-specific marker proteins. The dynamic 
      phosphoproteomes combined with a kinome-targeted CRISPR/Cas9 screen uncovered 
      coordinated networks of erythropoietic kinases and pinpointed downregulation of 
      c-Kit/MAPK signaling axis as key driver of maturation. Our system-wide view 
      establishes the functional dynamic of complex phosphosignaling networks and 
      regulation through proteome remodeling in erythropoiesis.

AB  - Protein folding in the cell is mediated by an extensive network of >1,000 
      chaperones, quality control factors, and trafficking mechanisms collectively termed 
      the proteostasis network. While the components and organization of this network are 
      generally well established, our understanding of how protein-folding problems are 
      identified, how the network components integrate to successfully address challenges, 
      and what types of biophysical issues each proteostasis network component is capable 
      of addressing remains immature. We describe a chemical biology-informed framework 
      for studying cellular proteostasis that relies on selection of interesting 
      protein-folding problems and precise researcher control of proteostasis network 
      composition and activities. By combining these methods with multifaceted strategies 
      to monitor protein folding, degradation, trafficking, and aggregation in cells, 
      researchers continue to rapidly generate new insights into cellular proteostasis.

AB  - Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) in combination with 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technologies have enabled the development of methods for large-scale 
      perturbation studies with transcriptional readouts. These methods are highly 
      scalable and have the potential to provide a wealth of information on the biological 
      networks that underlie cellular response. Here we discuss how to overcome several 
      key challenges to generate and analyse data for the confident reconstruction of 
      models of the underlying cellular network. Some challenges are generic, and apply to 
      analysing any single-cell transcriptomic data, while others are specific to combined 
      single-cell CRISPR/Cas9 data, in particular barcode swapping, knockdown efficiency, 
      multiplicity of infection and potential confounding factors. We also provide a 
      curated collection of published data sets to aid the development of analysis 
      strategies. Finally, we discuss several network reconstruction approaches, including 
      co-expression networks and Bayesian networks, as well as their limitations, and 
      highlight the potential of Nested Effects Models for network reconstruction from 
      scRNA-seq data. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcriptional 
      Profiles and Regulatory Gene Networks edited by Dr. Dr. Federico Manuel Giorgi and

AB  - Conventional affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS) analysis is 
      a broadly applicable method used to decipher molecular interaction networks and 
      infer protein function. However, it is sensitive to perturbations induced by 
      ectopically overexpressed target proteins and does not reflect multilevel 
      physiological regulation in response to diverse stimuli. Here, we developed an 
      interface between genome editing and proteomics to isolate native protein complexes 
      produced from their natural genomic contexts. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and TAL effector 
      nucleases (TALENs) to tag endogenous genes and purified several DNA repair and 
      chromatin-modifying holoenzymes to near homogeneity. We uncovered subunits and 
      interactions among well-characterized complexes and report the isolation of MCM8/9, 
      highlighting the efficiency and robustness of the approach. These methods improve 
      and simplify both small- and large-scale explorations of protein interactions as 
      well as the study of biochemical activities and structure-function relationships.

TI  - Virulence of the Pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis Is Controlled by the CRISPR-Cas 
      Protein Cas3.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00852-20 [doi]
LID - e00852-20
AB  - The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas system is 
      a unique genomic entity that provides prokaryotic cells with adaptive and heritable 
      immunity. Initial studies identified CRISPRs as central elements used by bacteria to 
      protect against foreign nucleic acids; however, emerging evidence points to CRISPR 
      involvement in bacterial virulence. The present study aimed to identify the 
      participation of one CRISPR-Cas protein, Cas3, in the virulence of the oral pathogen 
      Porphyromonas gingivalis, an organism highly associated with periodontitis. Our 
      results show that compared to the wild type, a mutant with a deletion of the Cas3 
      gene, an essential nuclease part of the class 1 type I CRISPR-Cas system, increased 
      the virulence of P. gingivalis In vitro infection modeling revealed only mildly 
      enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines by THP-1 cells when infected with 
      the mutant strain. Dual transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of infected 
      THP-1 cells showed an increase in expression of genes associated with pathogenesis 
      in response to Δcas3 mutant infection, with the target of Cas3 activities in 
      neutrophil chemotaxis and gene silencing. The importance of cas3 in controlling 
      virulence was corroborated in a Galleria mellonella infection model, where the 
      presence of the Δcas3 mutant resulted in a statistically significant increase in 
      mortality of G. mellonella A time-series analysis of transcription patterning during 
      infection showed that G. mellonella elicited very different immune responses to the 
      wild-type and the Δcas3 mutant strains and revealed a rearrangement of association 
      in coexpression networks. Together, these observations show for the first time that 
      Cas3 plays a significant role in regulating the virulence of P. gingivalis 
      IMPORTANCE Porphyromonas gingivalis is a key pathogen of periodontitis, a 
      polymicrobial disease characterized by a chronic inflammation that destroys the 
      tissues supporting the teeth. Thus, understanding the virulence potential of P. 
      gingivalis is essential to maintaining a healthy oral microbiome. In nonoral 
      organisms, CRISPR-Cas systems have been shown to modulate a variety of microbial 
      processes, including protection from exogenous nucleic acids, and, more recently, 
      have been implicated in bacterial virulence. Previously, our clinical findings 
      identified activation of the CRISPR-Cas system in patient samples at the transition 
      to disease; however, the mechanism of contribution to disease remained unknown. The 
      importance of the present study resides in that it is becoming increasingly clear 
      that CRISPR-associated proteins have broader functions than initially thought and 
      that those functions now include their role in the virulence of periodontal 
      pathogens. Studying a P. gingivalis cas3 mutant, we demonstrate that at least one of 
      the CRISPR-Cas systems is involved in the regulation of virulence during infection.

TI  - Cas9 effector-mediated regulation of transcription and differentiation in human 
      pluripotent stem cells.
PG  - 219-23
LID - 10.1242/dev.103341 [doi]
AB  - The identification of the trans-acting factors and cis-regulatory modules that are 
      involved in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) maintenance and differentiation is 
      necessary to dissect the operating regulatory networks in these processes and 
      thereby identify nodes where signal input will direct desired cell fate decisions in 
      vitro or in vivo. To deconvolute these networks, we established a method to 
      influence the differentiation state of hPSCs with a CRISPR-associated catalytically 
      inactive dCas9 fused to an effector domain. In human embryonic stem cells, we find 
      that the dCas9 effectors can exert positive or negative regulation on the expression 
      of developmentally relevant genes, which can influence cell differentiation status 
      when impinging on a key node in the regulatory network that governs the cell state. 
      This system provides a platform for the interrogation of the underlying regulators 
      governing specific differentiation decisions, which can then be employed to direct 
      cellular differentiation down desired pathways.

AB  - Understanding how genes are expressed in the correct cell types and at the correct 
      level is a key goal of developmental biology research. Gene regulation has 
      traditionally been approached largely through observational methods, whereas 
      perturbational approaches have lacked precision. CRISPR-Cas9 has begun to transform 
      the study of gene regulation, allowing for precise manipulation of genomic 
      sequences, epigenetic functionalization and gene expression. CRISPR-Cas9 technology 
      has already led to the discovery of new paradigms in gene regulation and, as new 
      CRISPR-based tools and methods continue to be developed, promises to transform our 
      knowledge of the gene regulatory code and our ability to manipulate cell fate. Here, 
      we discuss the current and future application of the emerging CRISPR toolbox toward 
      predicting gene regulatory network behavior, improving stem cell disease modeling, 
      dissecting the epigenetic code, reprogramming cell fate and treating diseases of 
      gene dysregulation.

AB  - One key advantage of RNA over genomic editing is its temporary effects. Aside from 
      current use of DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas9, the more recently discovered CRISPR-Cas13 
      has been explored as a means of editing due to its RNA-targeting capabilities. 
      Specifically, there has been a recent interest in identifying and functionally 
      characterizing biochemical RNA modifications, which has spurred a new field of 
      research known as "epitranscriptomics". As one of the most frequently occurring 
      transcriptome modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has generated much interest. 
      The presence of m6A modifications is under the tight control of a series of 
      regulators, and the ability of fusing these proteins or demethylases to 
      catalytically inactive CRISPR proteins have resulted in a new wave of programmable 
      RNA methylation tools. In addition, studies have been conducted to develop different 
      CRISPR/Cas and base editor systems capable of more efficient editing, and some have 
      explored the effects of in vivo editing for certain diseases. As well, the 
      application of CRISPR and base editors for screening shows promise in revealing the 
      phenotypic outcomes from m6A modification, many of which are linked to 
      physiological, and pathological effects. Thus, the therapeutic potential of 
      CRISPR/Cas and base editors for not only m6A related, but other RNA and DNA related 
      disease has also garnered insight. In this review, we summarize/discuss the recent 
      findings on RNA editing with CRISPR, base editors and non-CRISPR related tools and 
      offer a perspective regarding future applications for basic and clinical research.

AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated systems 
      have revolutionized genome engineering by facilitating a wide range of targeted DNA 
      perturbations. These systems have resulted in the development of powerful new 
      screens to test gene functions at the genomic scale. While there is tremendous 
      potential to map and interrogate gene regulatory networks at unprecedented speed and 
      scale using CRISPR screens, their implementation in plants remains in its infancy. 
      Here we discuss the general concepts, tools, and workflows for establishing CRISPR 
      screens in plants and analyze the handful of recent reports describing the use of 
      this strategy to generate mutant knockout collections or to diversify DNA sequences. 
      In addition, we provide insight into how to design CRISPR knockout screens in plants 
      given the current challenges and limitations and examine multiple design options. 
      Finally, we discuss the unique multiplexing capabilities of CRISPR screens to 
      investigate redundant gene functions in highly duplicated plant genomes. 
      Combinatorial mutant screens have the potential to routinely generate higher-order 
      mutant collections and facilitate the characterization of gene networks. By 
      integrating this approach with the numerous genomic profiles that have been 
      generated over the past two decades, the implementation of CRISPR screens offers new 
      opportunities to analyze plant genomes at deeper resolution and will lead to great 
      advances in functional and synthetic biology.

AB  - We report the first application of CRISPR-Cas technology to single species detection 
      from environmental DNA (eDNA). Organisms shed and excrete DNA into their environment 
      such as in skin cells and faeces, referred to as environmental DNA (eDNA). Utilising 
      eDNA allows noninvasive monitoring with increased specificity and sensitivity. 
      Current methods primarily employ PCR-based techniques to detect a given species from 
      eDNA samples, posing a logistical challenge for on-site monitoring and potential 
      adaptation to biosensor devices. We have developed an alternative method; coupling 
      isothermal amplification to a CRISPR-Cas12a detection system. This utilises the 
      collateral cleavage activity of Cas12a, a ribonuclease guided by a highly specific 
      single CRISPR RNA. We used the target species Salmo salar as a proof-of-concept test 
      of the specificity of the assay among closely related species and to show the assay 
      is successful at a single temperature of 37°C with signal detection at 535 nM. The 
      specific assay, detects at attomolar sensitivity with rapid detection rates 
      (<2.5 hr). This approach simplifies the challenge of building a biosensor device for 
      rapid target species detection in the field and can be easily adapted to detect any 
      species from eDNA samples from a variety of sources enhancing the capabilities of 
      eDNA as a tool for monitoring biodiversity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this review, we focus on the application of clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated nuclease 9 (Cas9), 
      as a powerful genome editing system, in the identification of resistance mechanisms 
      and in overcoming drug resistance in the most frequent solid tumors. DATA 
      ACQUISITION: Data were collected by conducting systematic searching of scientific 
      English literature using specific keywords such as "cancer", "CRISPR" and related 
      combinations. RESULTS: The review findings revealed the importance of CRISPR/Cas9 
      system in understanding drug resistance mechanisms and identification of 
      resistance-related genes such as PBRM1, SLFN11 and ATPE1 in different cancers. We 
      also provided an overview of genes, including RSF1, CDK5, and SGOL1, whose 
      disruption can synergize with the currently available drugs such as paclitaxel and 
      sorafenib. CONCLUSION: The data suggest CRISPR/Cas9 system as a useful tool in 
      elucidating the molecular basis of drug resistance and improving clinical outcomes.

AB  - Rapid diagnosis based on naked-eye colorimetric detection remains challenging, but 
      it could build new capacities for molecular point-of-care testing (POCT). In this 
      study, we evaluated the performance of 16 types of single-stranded 
      DNA-fluorophore-quencher (ssDNA-FQ) reporters for use with clusters of regularly 
      spaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPR)/Cas12a-based visual colorimetric assays. 
      Among them, nine ssDNA-FQ reporters were found to be suitable for direct visual 
      colorimetric detection, with especially very strong performance using ROX-labeled 
      reporters. We optimized the reaction concentrations of these ssDNA-FQ reporters for 
      a naked-eye read-out of assay results (no transducing component required for 
      visualization). In particular, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm 
      to standardize and automate the analytical colorimetric assessment of images and 
      integrated this into the MagicEye mobile phone software. A field-deployable assay 
      platform named RApid VIsual CRISPR (RAVI-CRISPR) based on a ROX-labeled reporter 
      with isothermal amplification and CRISPR/Cas12a targeting was established. We 
      deployed RAVI-CRISPR in a single tube toward an instrument-less colorimetric POCT 
      format that required only a portable rechargeable hand warmer for incubation. The 
      RAVI-CRISPR was successfully used for the high-sensitivity detection of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and African swine fever virus 
      (ASFV). Our study demonstrates this RAVI-CRISPR/MagicEye system to be suitable for 
      distinguishing different pathogenic nucleic acid targets with high specificity and 
      sensitivity as the simplest-to-date platform for rapid pen- or bed-side testing.

AB  - The genome-wide perturbation of transcriptional networks with CRISPR-Cas technology 
      has primarily involved systematic and targeted gene modulation. Here, we developed 
      PRISM (Perturbing Regulatory Interactions by Synthetic Modulators), a screening 
      platform that uses randomized CRISPR-Cas transcription factors (crisprTFs) to 
      globally perturb transcriptional networks. By applying PRISM to a yeast model of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), we identified guide RNAs (gRNAs) that modulate 
      transcriptional networks and protect cells from alpha-synuclein (αSyn) toxicity. One 
      gRNA identified in this screen outperformed the most protective suppressors of αSyn 
      toxicity reported previously, highlighting PRISM's ability to identify modulators of 
      important phenotypes. Gene expression profiling revealed genes differentially 
      modulated by this strong protective gRNA that rescued yeast from αSyn toxicity when 
      overexpressed. Human homologs of top-ranked hits protected against αSyn-induced cell 
      death in a human neuronal PD model. Thus, high-throughput and unbiased perturbation 
      of transcriptional networks via randomized crisprTFs can reveal complex biological 
      phenotypes and effective disease modulators.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic microorganisms with high commercial 
      potential. They can utilize sunlight directly to convert carbon dioxide or even 
      nitrogen into a variety of industrially relevant chemicals. However, commercial 
      platforms for the renewable and sustainable production of chemicals have yet to be 
      demonstrated for cyanobacteria. Diverse strategies have therefore been employed in 
      recent years to improve the production yields and efficiency of target chemicals. 
      These include the use of CRISPR/Cas systems for mutant selection, synthetic RNA 
      elements for controlling transcription, metabolic network modelling for 
      understanding pathway fluxes, enzyme engineering, improving growth rates, 
      alleviating product toxicity and microbial consortia. More elaborate strategies for 
      engineering cyanobacteria, however, are still very much required if we are to meet 
      the grand challenge of employing cyanobacteria as photosynthetic workhorses for 
      large-scale industrial applications.

TI  - Prediction of CRISPR sgRNA Activity Using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
PG  - 615-624
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00368 [doi]
AB  - The CRISPR-Cas9 system derived from adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea has 
      been developed into a powerful tool for genome engineering with wide-ranging 
      applications. Optimizing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) design to improve efficiency of 
      target cleavage is a key step for successful gene editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 
      system. Because not all sgRNAs that cognate to a given target gene are equally 
      effective, computational tools have been developed based on experimental data to 
      increase the likelihood of selecting effective sgRNAs. Despite considerable efforts 
      to date, it still remains a big challenge to accurately predict functional sgRNAs 
      directly from large-scale sequence data. We propose DeepCas9, a deep-learning 
      framework based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), to automatically learn 
      the sequence determinants and further enable the identification of functional sgRNAs 
      for the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We show that the CNN method outperforms previous methods 
      in both (i) the ability to correctly identify highly active sgRNAs in experiments 
      not used in the training and (ii) the ability to accurately predict the target 
      efficacies of sgRNAs in different organisms. Besides, we further visualize the 
      convolutional kernels and show the match of identified sequence signatures and known 
      nucleotide preferences. We finally demonstrate the application of our method to the 
      design of next-generation genome-scale CRISPRi and CRISPRa libraries targeting human 
      and mouse genomes. We expect that DeepCas9 will assist in reducing the numbers of 
      sgRNAs that must be experimentally validated to enable more effective and efficient 
      genetic screens and genome engineering. DeepCas9 can be freely accessed via the 
      Internet at https://github.com/lje00006/DeepCas9 .

AB  - To avoid the ethical issues of embryonic stem cells, genome engineering has focused 
      on inducible pluripotent stem cells, which can develop into all 3 germ layers. The 
      ability to detect methylation patterns in these cells allows research into 
      pluripotency markers. The recently developed CRISPR system has allowed widespread 
      application of genome engineering techniques. The CRISPR-Cas9 system, a potent 
      system for genome editing, can be used for gene knockout or knock-in genome 
      manipulations through substitution of a target genetic sequence with a desired donor 
      sequence. Two types of genome engineering can be initiated: homologous or 
      nonhomologous DNA repair by the Cas9 nuclease. Delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 and 
      target donor vectors in human pluripotent stem cells can be accomplished via viral 
      and nonviral delivery methods. Nonviral delivery includes lipid-mediated 
      transfection and electroporation. It has become the most common and efficient in 
      vitro delivery method for human pluripotent stem cells. The CRISPR-Cas9 system can 
      be combined with inducible pluripotent stem cells to generate single or multiple 
      gene knockouts, correct mutations, or insert reporter transgenes. Knockouts can also 
      be utilized to investigate epigenetic roles and targets, such as investigation of 
      DNA methylation. CRISPR could be combined with human pluripotent stem cells to 
      explore genetic determinants of lineage choice, differentiation, and stem cell fate, 
      allowing investigators to study how various genes or noncoding elements contribute 
      to specific processes and pathways. The CRISPR-Cas9 system can also be used to 
      create null or nucleasedead Cas9, which has no enzymatic activity but has been 
      utilized through fusion with other functional protein domains. In conclusion, 
      RNA-guided genome targeting will have broad implications for synthetic biology, 
      direct perturbation of gene networks, and targeted ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy.

AB  - Determining causal relationships between distinct chromatin features and gene 
      expression, and ultimately cell behavior, remains a major challenge. Recent 
      developments in targetable epigenome-editing tools enable us to assign direct 
      transcriptional and functional consequences to locus-specific chromatin 
      modifications. This Protocol Review discusses the unprecedented opportunity that 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology offers for investigating and manipulating the epigenome to 
      facilitate further understanding of stem cell biology and engineering of stem cells 
      for therapeutic applications. We also provide technical considerations for 
      standardization and further improvement of the CRISPR/Cas9-based tools to engineer 
      the epigenome.

TI  - Genetic compensation induced by deleterious mutations but not gene knockdowns.
PG  - 230-3
LID - 10.1038/nature14580 [doi]
AB  - Cells sense their environment and adapt to it by fine-tuning their transcriptome. 
      Wired into this network of gene expression control are mechanisms to compensate for 
      gene dosage. The increasing use of reverse genetics in zebrafish, and other model 
      systems, has revealed profound differences between the phenotypes caused by genetic 
      mutations and those caused by gene knockdowns at many loci, an observation 
      previously reported in mouse and Arabidopsis. To identify the reasons underlying the 
      phenotypic differences between mutants and knockdowns, we generated mutations in 
      zebrafish egfl7, an endothelial extracellular matrix gene of therapeutic interest, 
      as well as in vegfaa. Here we show that egfl7 mutants do not show any obvious 
      phenotypes while animals injected with egfl7 morpholino (morphants) exhibit severe 
      vascular defects. We further observe that egfl7 mutants are less sensitive than 
      their wild-type siblings to Egfl7 knockdown, arguing against residual protein 
      function in the mutants or significant off-target effects of the morpholinos when 
      used at a moderate dose. Comparing egfl7 mutant and morphant proteomes and 
      transcriptomes, we identify a set of proteins and genes that are upregulated in 
      mutants but not in morphants. Among them are extracellular matrix genes that can 
      rescue egfl7 morphants, indicating that they could be compensating for the loss of 
      Egfl7 function in the phenotypically wild-type egfl7 mutants. Moreover, egfl7 CRISPR 
      interference, which obstructs transcript elongation and causes severe vascular 
      defects, does not cause the upregulation of these genes. Similarly, vegfaa mutants 
      but not morphants show an upregulation of vegfab. Taken together, these data reveal 
      the activation of a compensatory network to buffer against deleterious mutations, 
      which was not observed after translational or transcriptional knockdown.

      to discriminate plasmids and phages.
PG  - 162-172
LID - 10.1038/s41564-020-00822-7 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria harbour multiple innate defences and adaptive CRISPR-Cas systems that 
      provide immunity against bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements. Although some 
      bacteria modulate defences in response to population density, stress and metabolic 
      state, a lack of high-throughput methods to systematically reveal regulators has 
      hampered efforts to understand when and how immune strategies are deployed. We 
      developed a robust approach called SorTn-seq, which combines saturation transposon 
      mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and deep sequencing to characterize 
      regulatory networks controlling CRISPR-Cas immunity in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. We 
      applied our technology to assess csm gene expression for ~300,000 mutants and 
      uncovered multiple pathways regulating type III-A CRISPR-Cas expression. Mutation of 
      igaA or mdoG activated the Rcs outer-membrane stress response, eliciting 
      cell-surface-based innate immunity against diverse phages via the transcriptional 
      regulators RcsB and RcsA. Activation of this Rcs phosphorelay concomitantly 
      attenuated adaptive immunity by three distinct type I and III CRISPR-Cas systems. 
      Rcs-mediated repression of CRISPR-Cas defence enabled increased acquisition and 
      retention of plasmids. Dual downregulation of cell-surface receptors and adaptive 
      immunity in response to stress by the Rcs pathway enables protection from phage 
      infection without preventing the uptake of plasmids that may harbour beneficial 
      traits.

TI  - Genetic Ablation of HLA Class I, Class II, and the T-cell Receptor Enables 
      Allogeneic T Cells to Be Used for Adoptive T-cell Therapy.
PG  - 926-936
LID - 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-18-0508 [doi]
AB  - Adoptive immunotherapy can induce sustained therapeutic effects in some cancers. 
      Antitumor T-cell grafts are often individually prepared in vitro from autologous T 
      cells, which requires an intensive workload and increased costs. The quality of the 
      generated T cells can also be variable, which affects the therapy's antitumor 
      efficacy and toxicity. Standardized production of antitumor T-cell grafts from 
      third-party donors will enable widespread use of this modality if allogeneic T-cell 
      responses are effectively controlled. Here, we generated HLA class I, HLA class II, 
      and T-cell receptor (TCR) triple-knockout (tKO) T cells by simultaneous knockout of 
      the B2M, CIITA, and TRAC genes through Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein electroporation. 
      Although HLA-deficient T cells were targeted by natural killer cells, they persisted 
      better than HLA-sufficient T cells in the presence of allogeneic peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) in immunodeficient mice. When transduced with a CD19 
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and stimulated by tumor cells, tKO CAR-T cells 
      persisted better when cultured with allogeneic PBMCs compared with TRAC and B2M 
      double-knockout T cells. The CD19 tKO CAR-T cells did not induce graft-versus-host 
      disease but retained antitumor responses. These results demonstrated the benefit of 
      HLA class I, HLA class II, and TCR deletion in enabling allogeneic-sourced T cells 
      to be used for off-the-shelf adoptive immunotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many fungi grow as saprobic organisms and obtain nutrients from a wide 
      range of dead organic materials. Among saprobes, fungal species that grow on wood or 
      in polluted environments have evolved prolific mechanisms for the production of 
      degrading compounds, such as ligninolytic enzymes. These enzymes include arrays of 
      intense redox-potential oxidoreductase, such as laccase, catalase, and peroxidases. 
      The ability to produce ligninolytic enzymes makes a variety of fungal species 
      suitable for application in many industries, including the production of biofuels 
      and antibiotics, bioremediation, and biomedical application as biosensors. However, 
      fungal ligninolytic enzymes are produced naturally in small quantities that may not 
      meet the industrial or market demands. Over the last decade, combined synthetic 
      biology and computational designs have yielded significant results in enhancing the 
      synthesis of natural compounds in fungi. In this review, we gave insights into 
      different protein engineering methods, including rational, semi-rational, and 
      directed evolution approaches that have been employed to enhance the production of 
      some important ligninolytic enzymes in fungi. We described the role of metabolic 
      pathway engineering to optimize the synthesis of chemical compounds of interest in 
      various fields. We highlighted synthetic biology novel techniques for biosynthetic 
      gene cluster (BGC) activation in fungo and heterologous reconstruction of BGC in 
      microbial cells. We also discussed in detail some recombinant ligninolytic enzymes 
      that have been successfully enhanced and expressed in different heterologous hosts. 
      Finally, we described recent advance in CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced 
      Short Palindromic Repeats)-Cas (CRISPR associated) protein systems as the most 
      promising biotechnology for large-scale production of ligninolytic enzymes. SHORT 
      CONCLUSION: Aggregation, expression, and regulation of ligninolytic enzymes in fungi 
      require very complex procedures with many interfering factors. Synthetic and 
      computational biology strategies, as explained in this review, are powerful tools 
      that can be combined to solve these puzzles. These integrated strategies can lead to 
      the production of enzymes with special abilities, such as wide substrate 
      specifications, thermo-stability, tolerance to long time storage, and stability in 
      different substrate conditions, such as pH and nutrients.

TI  - CIGAR-seq, a CRISPR/Cas-based method for unbiased screening of novel mRNA 
      modification regulators.

AB  - Cellular RNA is decorated with over 170 types of chemical modifications. Many 
      modifications in mRNA, including m(6) A and m(5) C, have been associated with 
      critical cellular functions under physiological and/or pathological conditions. To 
      understand the biological functions of these modifications, it is vital to identify 
      the regulators that modulate the modification rate. However, a high-throughput 
      method for unbiased screening of these regulators is so far lacking. Here, we report 
      such a method combining pooled CRISPR screen and reporters with RNA modification 
      readout, termed CRISPR integrated gRNA and reporter sequencing (CIGAR-seq). Using 
      CIGAR-seq, we discovered NSUN6 as a novel mRNA m(5) C methyltransferase. Subsequent 
      mRNA bisulfite sequencing in HAP1 cells without or with NSUN6 and/or NSUN2 knockout 
      showed that NSUN6 and NSUN2 worked on non-overlapping subsets of mRNA m(5) C sites 
      and together contributed to almost all the m(5) C modification in mRNA. Finally, 
      using m(1) A as an example, we demonstrated that CIGAR-seq can be easily adapted for 
      identifying regulators of other mRNA modification.

AB  - The study of transcriptional regulation of tomato ripening has been led by 
      spontaneous mutations in transcription factor (TF) genes that completely inhibit 
      normal ripening, suggesting that they are 'master regulators'. Studies using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to produce knockouts of the underlying genes indicate a 
      different picture, suggesting that the regulation is more robust than previously 
      thought. This requires us to revisit our model of the regulation of ripening and 
      replace it with one involving a network of partially redundant components. At the 
      same time, the fast rise of CRISPR/Cas mutagenesis, resulting in unexpectedly weak 
      phenotypes, compared with knockdown technology, suggests that compensatory 
      mechanisms may obscure protein functions. This emphasises the need for assessment of 
      these mechanisms in plants and for the careful design of mutagenesis experiments.

AB  - Targeted endogenous gene activation is necessary for understanding complex gene 
      networks and has great potential in medical and industrial applications. The 
      CRISPR-Cas system offers simple and powerful tools for this purpose. However, these 
      CRISPR-Cas-based tools for activating user-defined genes are unable to offer precise 
      temporal control of gene expression, despite the fact that many biological phenomena 
      are regulated by highly dynamic patterns of gene expression. Here we created a 
      light-inducible, user-defined, endogenous gene activation system based on 
      CRISPR-Cas9. We demonstrated that this CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system can 
      allow rapid and reversible targeted gene activation by light. In addition, using 
      this system, we have exemplified photoactivation of multiple user-defined endogenous 
      genes in mammalian cells. The present CRISPR-Cas9-based transcription system offers 
      simple and versatile approaches for precise endogenous gene activation in basic 
      biological research and biotechnology applications.

AB  - Dissecting the complex network of epigenetic modifications requires tools that 
      combine precise recognition of DNA sequences with the capability to modify 
      epigenetic marks. The CRISPR/Cas system has been proven to be a valuable addition to 
      existing methodologies that fulfill these tasks. So far, sequence-specific editing 
      of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational 
      modifications relied on direct fusions of enzymatically inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) 
      with epigenetic effectors. Here, we report a novel, modular system that facilitates 
      the recruitment of any GFP-tagged protein to desired genomic loci. By fusing dCas9 
      to a GFP-binding nanobody (GBP) we demonstrate that prevalent epigenetic 
      modifications at mouse major satellite repeats can be erased or set de novo by 
      recruiting GFP-coupled catalytic domains of TET1 and DNMT3A, respectively. 
      Furthermore, we construct an inducible expression system that enables a temporally 
      controlled expression of both GBP-dCas9 and the effector protein. Thus, our approach 
      further expands the CRISPR/Cas toolbox for site-specific manipulation of epigenetic 
      modifications with a modular and easy-to-use system.

AB  - The genotype-to-phenotype relationship in health and disease is complex and 
      influenced by both an individual's environment and their unique genome. Personal 
      genetic variants can modulate gene function to generate a phenotype either through a 
      single gene effect or through genetic interactions involving two or more genes. The 
      relevance of genetic interactions to disease phenotypes has been particularly clear 
      in cancer research, where an extreme genetic interaction, synthetic lethality, has 
      been exploited as a therapeutic strategy. The obvious benefits of unmasking genetic 
      background-specific vulnerabilities, coupled with the power of systematic genome 
      editing, have fueled efforts to translate genetic interaction mapping from model 
      organisms to human cells. Here, we review recent developments in genetic interaction 
      mapping, with a focus on CRISPR-based genome editing technologies and cancer.

AB  - With the development of synthetic biology, synthetic gene circuits have shown great 
      applied potential in medicine, biology, and as commodity chemicals. An ultimate 
      challenge in the construction of gene circuits is the lack of effective, 
      programmable, secure and sequence-specific gene editing tools. The clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, a CRISPR-associated 
      RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-targeted genome editing 
      tool, has recently been applied in engineering gene circuits for its unique 
      properties-operability, high efficiency and programmability. The traditional 
      single-targeted therapy cannot effectively distinguish tumour cells from normal 
      cells, and gene therapy for single targets has poor anti-tumour effects, which 
      severely limits the application of gene therapy. Currently, the design of gene 
      circuits using tumour-specific targets based on CRISPR/Cas systems provides a new 
      way for precision cancer therapy. Hence, the application of intelligentized gene 
      circuits based on CRISPR technology effectively guarantees the safety, efficiency 
      and specificity of cancer therapy. Here, we assessed the use of synthetic gene 
      circuits and if the CRISPR system could be used, especially artificial 
      switch-inducible Cas9, to more effectively target and treat tumour cells. Moreover, 
      we also discussed recent advances, prospectives and underlying challenges in 
      CRISPR-based gene circuit development.

AB  - In addition to their roles as revolutionary genome engineering tools, CRISPR-Cas 
      systems are also highly promising candidates in the construction of biosensing 
      systems and diagnostic devices, which have attracted significant attention recently. 
      However, the CRISPR-Cas system cannot be directly applied in the sensing of 
      non-nucleic acid targets, and the needs of synthesizing and storing different 
      vulnerable guide RNA for different targets also increase the application and storage 
      costs of relevant biosensing systems, and therefore restrict their widespread 
      applications. To tackle these barriers, in this work, a versatile 
      CRISPR-Cas12a-based biosensing platform was developed through the introduction of an 
      enzyme-free and robust DNA reaction network, the entropy-driven dynamic DNA network. 
      By programming the sequences of the system, the entropy-driven catalysis-based 
      dynamic DNA network can respond to different types of targets, such as nucleic acids 
      or proteins, and then activate the CRISPR-Cas12a to generate amplified signals. As a 
      proof of concept, both nucleic acid targets (a DNA target with random sequence, T, 
      and an RNA target, microRNA-21 (miR-21)) and a non-nucleic acid target (a protein 
      target, thrombin) were chosen as model analytes to address the feasibility of the 
      designed sensing platform, with detection limits at the pM level for the nucleic 
      acid analytes (7.4 pM for the DNA target T and 25.5 pM for miR-21) and 0.4 nM for 
      thrombin. In addition, the detection of miR-21 or thrombin in human serum samples 
      further demonstrated the applicability of the proposed biosensing platform in real 
      sample analysis.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNA), a class of transcripts with lengths >200 nt, play a 
      master role in the regulation of cancer pathogenesis. Recently, the CRISPR-Cas9 
      system has been explored as a revolutionary genome editing tool for molecular 
      biology. Growing evidence shows that LncRNAs can be targeted by the CRISPR-Cas9 
      system used for evaluating its function. Thus, the CRISPR-Cas9 systems provide a 
      novel gene-editing strategy for the modification of LncRNA expression. This review 
      summarizes current knowledge of the functions and underlying mechanisms of LncRNA by 
      CRISPR-Cas9. Emerging strategies for non-viral/viral delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 in a 
      clinical context are also discussed.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeat/CRISPR-associated protein 9) provides a workhorse for genome editing 
      biotechnology. CRISPR/Cas9 tailored for enabling genome editing has been extensively 
      interrogated and widely utilized for precise genomic alterations in eukaryotic 
      organisms including in plant species. The technology holds the great promise to 
      better understand gene functions, elucidate networks, and improve the performance of 
      crop plants such as increasing grain yields, improving nutritional content, and 
      better combating the biotic and abiotic stresses. Various methods or protocols 
      specific for different plant species have been established. Here, we present a 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing protocol in rice, including detailed information 
      about single-guide RNA design, vector construction, plant transformation, and mutant 
      screening processes.

TI  - Divalent-Metal-Ion Selectivity of the CRISPR-Cas System-Associated Cas1 Protein: 
      Insights from Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Electronic Structure 
      Calculations.
PG  - 11943-11954
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c07744 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-associated protein 1 (Cas1) is a universally conserved essential 
      metalloenzyme of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR) immune system of prokaryotes (bacteria, archaea) that can cut and integrate 
      a part of viral DNA to its host genome with the help of other proteins. The 
      integrated DNA acts as a memory of viral infection, which can be transcribed to RNA 
      and stop future infection by recognition (based on the RNA/DNA complementarity 
      principle) followed by protein-mediated degradation of the viral DNA. It has been 
      proposed that the presence of a single manganese (Mn(2+)) ion in a conserved 
      divalent-metal-ion binding pocket (key residues: E190, H254, D265, D268) of Cas1 is 
      crucial for its function. Cas1-mediated DNA degradation was proposed to be hindered 
      by metal substitution, metal chelation, or mutation of the binding pocket residues. 
      Cas1 is active toward dsDNA degradation with both Mn(2+) and Mg(2+). X-ray 
      structures of Cas1 revealed an intricate atomic interaction network of the 
      divalent-metal-ion binding pocket and opened up the possibility of modeling related 
      metal ions (viz., Mg(2+), Ca(2+)) in the binding pocket of wild-type (WT) and 
      mutated Cas1 proteins for computational analysis, which includes (1) quantitative 
      estimation of the energetics of the divalent-metal-ion preference and (2) exploring 
      the structural and dynamical aspects of the protein in response to 
      divalent-metal-ion substitution or amino acid mutation. Using the X-ray structure of 
      the Cas1 protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a template (PDB 3GOD), we performed 
      (∼2.23 μs) classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to compare structural and 
      dynamical differences between Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-bound binding pockets of wild-type 
      (WT) and mutant (E190A, H254A, D265A, D268A) Cas1. Furthermore, reduced binding 
      pocket models were generated from X-ray and molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, 
      and the resulting structures were subjected to quantum chemical calculations. 
      Results suggest that Cas1 prefers Mg(2+) binding relative to Ca(2+) and the 
      preference is the strongest for WT and the weakest for the D268A mutant. Quantum 
      chemical calculations indicate that Mn(2+) is the most preferred relative to both 
      Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) in the wild-type and mutant Cas1. Substitution of Mg(2+) by Ca(2+) 
      does not alter the interaction network between Cas1 and the divalent metal ion but 
      increases the wetness of the binding pocket by introducing a single water molecule 
      in the first coordination shell of the latter. The strength of metal-ion preference 
      (Mg(2+) versus Ca(2+)) seems to be dependent on the solvent accessibility of the 
      divalent-metal-ion binding pocket, strongest for wild-type Cas1 (in which the 
      metal-ion binding pocket is dry, which includes two water molecules) and the weakest 
      for the D268A mutant (in which the metal-ion binding pocket is wet, which includes 
      four water molecules).

AB  - Synthetic gene circuits allow us to govern cell behavior in a programmable manner, 
      which is central to almost any application aiming to harness engineered living cells 
      for user-defined tasks. Transcription factors (TFs) constitute the 'classic' tool 
      for synthetic circuit construction but some of their inherent constraints, such as 
      insufficient modularity, orthogonality and programmability, limit progress in such 
      forward-engineering endeavors. Here we review how CRISPR (clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats) technology offers new and powerful 
      possibilities for synthetic circuit design. CRISPR systems offer superior 
      characteristics over TFs in many aspects relevant to a modular, predictable and 
      standardized circuit design. Thus, the choice of CRISPR technology as a framework 
      for synthetic circuit design constitutes a valid alternative to complement or 
      replace TFs in synthetic circuits and promises the realization of more ambitious 
      designs.

TI  - Identification of Novel Insulin Resistance Related ceRNA Network in T2DM and Its 
      Potential Editing by CRISPR/Cas9.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22158129 [doi]
LID - 8129
AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of morbidity and 
      mortality worldwide and is derived from an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic 
      changes. In this study, we aimed to construct Insilco, a competing endogenous RNA 
      (ceRNA) network linked to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance followed by its 
      experimental validation in patients', matched control and cell line samples, as well 
      as to evaluate the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 as a potential therapeutic strategy to 
      modulate the expression of this deregulated network. By applying bioinformatics 
      tools through a two-step process, we identified and verified a ceRNA network panel 
      of mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNA related to insulin resistance, Then validated the 
      expression in clinical samples (123 patients and 106 controls) and some of matched 
      cell line samples using real time PCR. Next, two guide RNAs were designed to target 
      the sequence flanking LncRNA/miRNAs interaction by CRISPER/Cas9 in cell culture. 
      Gene editing tool efficacy was assessed by measuring the network downstream proteins 
      GLUT4 and mTOR via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: LncRNA-RP11-773H22.4, together with 
      RET, IGF1R and mTOR mRNAs, showed significant upregulation in T2DM compared with 
      matched controls, while miRNA (i.e., miR-3163 and miR-1) and mRNA (i.e., GLUT4 and 
      AKT2) expression displayed marked downregulation in diabetic samples. CRISPR/Cas9 
      successfully knocked out LncRNA-RP11-773H22.4, as evidenced by the reversal of the 
      gene expression of the identified network at RNA and protein levels to the normal 
      expression pattern after gene editing. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides the 
      significance of this ceRNA based network and its related target genes panel both in 
      the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and as a therapeutic target for gene editing 
      in T2DM.

AB  - The application of the CRISPR‐Cas9 system marks a major breakthrough for genetic 
      screens, particularly in mammalian cells where high‐throughput targeted gene editing 
      has been lacking. Parnas et al (2015) apply this screening technology to mouse bone 
      marrow‐derived dendritic cells in order to study the regulation of the immune 
      response triggered by PAMPs. Through integrated analysis of gene knockouts in 
      conjunction with changes in protein and mRNA expression, CRISPR screens are 
      facilitating dissection of immune regulatory networks at unprecedented resolution.

AB  - Cancer immunotherapy has gained attention as the supreme therapeutic modality for 
      the treatment of various malignancies. Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is one of the 
      most distinctive modalities of this therapeutic approach, which seeks to harness the 
      potential of combating cancer cells by using autologous or allogenic tumor-specific 
      T-cells. However, a plethora of circumstances must be optimized to produce 
      functional, durable, and efficient T-cells. Recently, the potential of ACT has been 
      further realized by the introduction of novel gene-editing platforms such as the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system; this technique has been utilized to create T-cells furnished 
      with recombinant T-cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that have 
      precise tumor antigen recognition, minimal side effects and treatment-related 
      toxicities, robust proliferation and cytotoxicity, and nominal exhaustion. Here, we 
      aim to review and categorize the recent breakthroughs of genetically modified 
      TCR/CAR T-cells through CRISPR/Cas9 technology and address the pearls and pitfalls 
      of each method. In addition, we investigate the latest ongoing clinical trials that 
      are applying CRISPR-associated TCR/CAR T-cells for the treatment of cancers.

AB  - Synthetic biology has the potential to provide decisive advances in genetic control 
      of metabolic pathways. However, there are several challenges that synthetic 
      biologists must overcome before this vision becomes a reality. First, a library of 
      diverse and well-characterized sensors, such as metabolite-sensing or 
      condition-sensing promoters, must be constructed. Second, robust programmable 
      circuits that link input conditions with a specific gene regulation response must be 
      developed. Finally, multi-gene targeting strategies must be integrated with 
      metabolically relevant sensors and complex, robust logic. Achievements in each of 
      these areas, which employ the CRISPR/Cas system, in silico modeling, and dynamic 
      sensor-regulators, among other tools, provide a strong basis for future research. 
      Overall, the future for synthetic biology approaches in metabolic engineering holds 
      immense promise.

AB  - Functional characterizations and molecular dissections of long noncoding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) are critical to understand their involvement in the cellular regulatory 
      network. LncRNAs exert their effects through functional RNA domains that interact 
      with other molecules, including proteins, DNA, and RNA. Here, we describe 
      experimental procedures for generating genomic deletions in a human haploid cell 
      line using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This method can be applied to examine functions 
      of lncRNAs and their domains by establishing knockout and partial deletion mutant 
      cell lines. In addition, we describe a CRISPR-mediated knockin method for artificial 
      tethering of partner RNA-binding proteins to lncRNAs and its use to validate 
      lncRNA-mediated functions.

AB  - One of the key drivers for successful metabolic engineering in microbes is the 
      efficacy by which genomes can be edited. As such there are many methods to choose 
      from when aiming to modify genomes, especially those of model organisms like yeast 
      and bacteria. In recent years, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR) and its associated proteins (Cas) have become the method of choice for 
      precision genome engineering in many organisms due to their orthogonality, 
      versatility and efficacy. Here we review the strategies adopted for implementation 
      of RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing with special emphasis on their application 
      for metabolic engineering of yeast and bacteria. Also, examples of how 
      nuclease-deficient Cas9 has been applied for RNA-guided transcriptional regulation 
      of target genes will be reviewed, as well as tools available for computer-aided 
      design of guide-RNAs will be highlighted. Finally, this review will provide a 
      perspective on the immediate challenges and opportunities foreseen by the use of 
      CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering and regulation in the context of metabolic 
      engineering.

AB  - Accurately controlling expression of target genes between several designed levels is 
      essential for low-noise gene network and dynamic range of gene expression. However, 
      such manipulations have been hard to achieve due to technical limitations. Based on 
      tandem promoters and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system, we constructed a multistage regulator that 
      could stably regulate the expression of the reporter gene on three levels, with more 
      than 2-fold difference between each of them. Our findings provide novel insights 
      into constructing a more powerful gene regulation system.

LID - 10.1038/nrrheum.2017.6 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has taken the research world by storm since 
      its use in eukaryotes was first proposed in 2012. Publications describing advances 
      in technology and new applications have continued at an unrelenting pace since that 
      time. In this Review, we discuss the application of CRISPR/Cas9 for creating gene 
      mutations - the application that initiated the current avalanche of interest - and 
      new developments that have largely answered initial concerns about its specificity 
      and ability to introduce new gene sequences. We discuss the new, diverse and rapidly 
      growing adaptations of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique that enable activation, repression, 
      multiplexing and gene screening. These developments have enabled researchers to 
      create sophisticated tools for dissecting the function and inter-relatedness of 
      genes, as well as noncoding regions of the genome, and to identify gene networks and 
      noncoding regions that promote disease or confer disease susceptibility. These 
      approaches are beginning to be used to interrogate complex and multilayered 
      biological systems and to produce complex animal models of disease. CRISPR/Cas9 
      technology has enabled the application of new therapeutic approaches to treating 
      disease in animal models, some of which are beginning to be seen in the first human 
      clinical trials. We discuss the direct application of these techniques to rheumatic 
      diseases, which are currently limited but are sure to increase rapidly in the near 
      future.

AB  - Since the breakthrough discoveries that CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases can be easily 
      programmed and employed to induce targeted double-strand breaks in mammalian cells, 
      the gene editing field has grown exponentially. Today, CRISPR technologies based on 
      engineered class II CRISPR effectors facilitate targeted modification of genes and 
      RNA transcripts. Moreover, catalytically impaired CRISPR-Cas variants can be 
      employed as programmable DNA binding domains and used to recruit effector proteins, 
      such as transcriptional regulators, epigenetic modifiers or base-modifying enzymes, 
      to selected genomic loci. The juxtaposition of CRISPR and optogenetics enables 
      spatiotemporally confined and highly dynamic genome perturbations in living cells 
      and animals and holds unprecedented potential for biology and biomedicine.Here, we 
      provide an overview of the state-of-the-art methods for light-control of CRISPR 
      effectors. We will detail the plethora of exciting applications enabled by these 
      systems, including spatially confined genome editing, timed activation of endogenous 
      genes, as well as remote control of chromatin-chromatin interactions. Finally, we 
      will discuss limitations of current optogenetic CRISPR tools and point out routes 
      for future innovation in this emerging field.

AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has reached critical levels, skyrocketing in 
      hospitals and the environment and posing a major threat to global public health. The 
      complex and challenging problem of reducing antibiotic resistance (AR) requires a 
      network of both societal and science-based solutions to preserve the most lifesaving 
      pharmaceutical intervention known to medicine. In addition to developing new classes 
      of antibiotics, it is essential to safeguard the clinical efficacy of existing 
      drugs. In this review, we examine the potential application of novel CRISPR-based 
      genetic approaches to reducing AR in both environmental and clinical settings and 
      prolonging the utility of vital antibiotics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zebrafish have practical features that make them a useful model for 
      higher-throughput tests of gene function using CRISPR/Cas9 editing to create 
      'knockout' models. In particular, the use of G(0) mosaic mutants has potential to 
      increase throughput of functional studies significantly but may suffer from 
      transient effects of introducing Cas9 via microinjection. Further, a large number of 
      computational and empirical tools exist to design CRISPR assays but often produce 
      varied predictions across methods leaving uncertainty in choosing an optimal 
      approach for zebrafish studies. METHODS: To systematically assess accuracy of tool 
      predictions of on- and off-target gene editing, we subjected zebrafish embryos to 
      CRISPR/Cas9 with 50 different guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting 14 genes. We also 
      investigate potential confounders of G(0)-based CRISPR screens by assaying control 
      embryos for spurious mutations and altered gene expression. RESULTS: We compared our 
      experimental in vivo editing efficiencies in mosaic G(0) embryos with those 
      predicted by eight commonly used gRNA design tools and found large discrepancies 
      between methods. Assessing off-target mutations (predicted in silico and in vitro) 
      found that the majority of tested loci had low in vivo frequencies (< 1%). To 
      characterize if commonly used 'mock' CRISPR controls (larvae injected with Cas9 
      enzyme or mRNA with no gRNA) exhibited spurious molecular features that might 
      exacerbate studies of G(0) mosaic CRISPR knockout fish, we generated an RNA-seq 
      dataset of various control larvae at 5 days post fertilization. While we found no 
      evidence of spontaneous somatic mutations of injected larvae, we did identify 
      several hundred differentially-expressed genes with high variability between 
      injection types. Network analyses of shared differentially-expressed genes in the 
      'mock' injected larvae implicated a number of key regulators of common metabolic 
      pathways, and gene-ontology analysis revealed connections with response to wounding 
      and cytoskeleton organization, highlighting a potentially lasting effect from the 
      microinjection process that requires further investigation. CONCLUSION: Overall, our 
      results provide a valuable resource for the zebrafish community for the design and 
      execution of CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.

AB  - The ability to change the genetic information of immune cells is a powerful tool for 
      basic and clinical settings. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology by providing an 
      efficient approach has accelerated immune cell therapy of cancers. Lymphoid cancers 
      comprise a wide array of disease including lymphoma, multiple myeloma and 
      lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we review therapeutic applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 
      technology for immune cell therapy of common lymphoid malignancies. We describe 
      current and future therapeutic application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology with the focus 
      on the production and applications of engineered hematopoietic and immune cells 
      against lymphoid malignancies. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the possible 
      challenges and optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 system for ex- and in vivo applications 
      within recent years.

LID - 87
AB  - Bioremediation is the degradation potential of microorganisms to dissimilate the 
      complex chemical compounds from the surrounding environment. The genetics and 
      biochemistry of biodegradation processes in datasets opened the way of systems 
      biology. Systemic biology aid the study of interacting parts involved in the system. 
      The significant keys of system biology are biodegradation network, computational 
      biology, and omics approaches. Biodegradation network consists of all the databases 
      and datasets which aid in assisting the degradation and deterioration potential of 
      microorganisms for bioremediation processes. This review deciphers the 
      bio-degradation network, i.e., the databases and datasets (UM-BBD, PAN, PTID, etc.) 
      aiding in assisting the degradation and deterioration potential of microorganisms 
      for bioremediation processes, computational biology and multi omics approaches like 
      metagenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics for the 
      efficient functional gene mining and their validation for bioremediation 
      experiments. Besides, the present review also describes the gene editing tools like 
      CRISPR Cas, TALEN, and ZFNs which can possibly make design microbe with functional 
      gene of interest for degradation of particular recalcitrant for improved 
      bioremediation.

AB  - DNA nanotechnology, and DNA computing in particular, has grown extensively over the 
      past decade to end with a variety of functional stable structures and dynamic 
      circuits. However, the use as designer elements of regular DNA pieces, perfectly 
      complementary double strands, has remained elusive. Here, we report the exploitation 
      of CRISPR-Cas systems to engineer logic circuits based on isothermal strand 
      displacement that perform with toehold-free double-stranded DNA. We designed and 
      implemented molecular converters for signal detection and amplification, showing 
      good interoperability between enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes. Overall, these 
      results contribute to enlarge the repertoire of substrates and reactions (hardware) 
      for DNA computing.

AB  - Genetic circuits require many regulatory parts in order to implement signal 
      processing or execute algorithms in cells. A potentially scalable approach is to use 
      dCas9, which employs small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to repress genetic loci via the 
      programmability of RNA:DNA base pairing. To this end, we use dCas9 and designed 
      sgRNAs to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform computation 
      in living cells. We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic 
      Escherichia coli σ70 promoters that are repressed by corresponding sgRNAs, and these 
      interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These sgRNAs exhibit high 
      on-target repression (56- to 440-fold) and negligible off-target interactions (< 
      1.3-fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the 
      Boolean-complete NOR gate and a 3-gate circuit consisting of four layered sgRNAs. 
      The synthetic circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by 
      designing output sgRNAs to target an E. coli transcription factor (malT). This 
      converts the output of a synthetic circuit to a switch in cellular phenotype (sugar 
      utilization, chemotaxis, phage resistance).

AB  - Temporal modulation of the expression of multiple genes underlies complex complex 
      biological phenomena. However, there are few scalable and generalizable gene circuit 
      architectures for the programming of sequential genetic perturbations. Here, we 
      describe a modular recombinase-based gene circuit architecture, comprising tandem 
      gene perturbation cassettes (GPCs), that enables the sequential expression of 
      multiple genes in a defined temporal order by alternating treatment with just two 
      orthogonal ligands. We use tandem GPCs to sequentially express single-guide RNAs to 
      encode transcriptional cascades that trigger the sequential accumulation of 
      mutations. We build an all-in-one gene circuit that sequentially edits genomic loci, 
      synchronizes cells at a specific stage within a gene expression cascade, and deletes 
      itself for safety. Tandem GPCs offer a multi-tiered cellular programming tool for 
      modeling multi-stage genetic changes, such as tumorigenesis and cellular 
      differentiation.

AB  - Brassinosteroids, the steroid hormones of plants, control physiological and 
      developmental processes through its signaling pathway. The major brassinosteroid 
      signaling network components, from the receptor to transcription factors, have been 
      identified in the past two decades. The development of biotechnologies has driven 
      the identification of novel brassinosteroid signaling components, even revealing 
      several crosstalks between brassinosteroid and other plant signaling pathways. 
      Herein, we would like to summarize the identification and improvement of several 
      representative brassinosteroid signaling components through the development of new 
      technologies, including brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 (BRI1), BRI1-associated kinase 
      1 (BAK1), BR-insensitive 2 (BIN2), BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1 (BKI1), BRI1-suppressor 1 
      (BSU1), BR signaling kinases (BSKs), BRI1 ethyl methanesulfonate suppressor 1 
      (BES1), and brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1). Furthermore, improvement of BR 
      signaling knowledge, such as the function of BKI1, BES1 and its homologous through 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), the regulation 
      of BIN2 through single-molecule methods, and the new in vivo interactors of BIN2 
      identified by proximity labeling are described. Among these technologies, recent 
      advanced methods proximity labeling and single-molecule methods will be reviewed in 
      detail to provide insights to brassinosteroid and other phytohormone signaling 
      pathway studies.

AB  - Improvements in genome editing technology in birds using primordial germ cells 
      (PGCs) have made the development of innovative era genome-edited avian models 
      possible, including specific chicken bioreactors, production of knock-in/out 
      chickens, low-allergenicity eggs, and disease-resistance models. New strategies, 
      including CRISPR/Cas9, have made gene editing easy and highly efficient in 
      comparison to the well-known process of homologous recombination. The clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technique enables us to 
      understand the function of genes and/or to modify the animal phenotype to fit a 
      specific scientific or production target. To facilitate chicken genome engineering 
      applications, we present a concise description of the method and current application 
      of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in chickens. Different strategies for delivering sgRNAs 
      and the Cas9 protein, we also present extensively. Furthermore, we describe a new 
      gesicle technology as a way to deliver Cas9/sgRNA complexes into target cells, and 
      we discuss the advantages and describe basal applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system 
      in a chicken model.

TI  - Does co-transcriptional regulation of alternative splicing mediate plant stress 
      responses?
PG  - 2716-2726
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz121 [doi]
AB  - Plants display exquisite control over gene expression to elicit appropriate 
      responses under normal and stress conditions. Alternative splicing (AS) of 
      pre-mRNAs, a process that generates two or more transcripts from multi-exon genes, 
      adds another layer of regulation to fine-tune condition-specific gene expression in 
      animals and plants. However, exactly how plants control splice isoform ratios and 
      the timing of this regulation in response to environmental signals remains elusive. 
      In mammals, recent evidence indicate that epigenetic and epitranscriptome changes, 
      such as DNA methylation, chromatin modifications and RNA methylation, regulate RNA 
      polymerase II processivity, co-transcriptional splicing, and stability and 
      translation efficiency of splice isoforms. In plants, the role of epigenetic 
      modifications in regulating transcription rate and mRNA abundance under stress is 
      beginning to emerge. However, the mechanisms by which epigenetic and 
      epitranscriptomic modifications regulate AS and translation efficiency require 
      further research. Dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape in response to stress 
      may provide a scaffold around which gene expression, AS and translation are 
      orchestrated. Finally, we discuss CRISPR/Cas-based strategies for engineering 
      chromatin architecture to manipulate AS patterns (or splice isoforms levels) to 
      obtain insight into the epigenetic regulation of AS.

TI  - A CRISPR-Assisted Nonhomologous End-Joining Strategy for Efficient Genome Editing in 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

LID - e02364-19
AB  - New tools for genetic manipulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are needed for the 
      development of new drug regimens and vaccines aimed at curing tuberculosis 
      infections. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems generate a highly specific 
      double-strand break at the target site that can be repaired via nonhomologous end 
      joining (NHEJ), resulting in the desired genome alteration. In this study, we first 
      improved the NHEJ repair pathway and developed a CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome-editing 
      method that allowed us to generate markerless deletion in Mycobacterium smegmatis, 
      Mycobacterium marinum, and M. tuberculosis Then, we demonstrated that this system 
      could efficiently achieve simultaneous generation of double mutations and 
      large-scale genetic mutations in M. tuberculosis Finally, we showed that the 
      strategy we developed can also be used to facilitate genome editing in Escherichia 
      coli IMPORTANCE The global health impact of M. tuberculosis necessitates the 
      development of new genetic tools for its manipulation, to facilitate the 
      identification and characterization of novel drug targets and vaccine candidates. 
      Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated 
      protein (Cas) genome editing has proven to be a powerful genetic tool in various 
      organisms; to date, however, attempts to use this approach in M. tuberculosis have 
      failed. Here, we describe a genome-editing tool based on CRISPR cleavage and the 
      nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway that can efficiently generate 
      deletion mutants in M. tuberculosis More importantly, this system can generate 
      simultaneous double mutations and large-scale genetic mutations in this species. We 
      anticipate that this CRISPR-NHEJ-assisted genome-editing system will be broadly 
      useful for research on mycobacteria, vaccine development, and drug target profiling.

AB  - Oncogenesis relies on the alteration of multiple driver genes, but precisely which 
      groups of alterations lead to cancer is not well understood. To chart these 
      combinations, Zhao and colleagues use the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knockout all 
      pairwise combinations among 52 tumor suppressor genes, with the goal of identifying 
      groups of alterations that collaborate to promote cell growth. Interaction screens 
      are performed across multiple models of tumorigenesis in cell cultures and mice, 
      revealing clear cooperation among NF2, PTEN, and TP53 in multiple models. These and 
      other strongly synergistic interactions are characterized further by single-cell 
      transcriptomic profiling. This methodology presents a scalable approach to move 
      beyond single-gene drivers to map the complex gene networks that give rise to 
      tumorigenesis.See related article by Zhao et al., p. 6090.

AB  - Repurposed CRISPR-Cas molecules provide a useful tool set for broad applications of 
      genomic editing and regulation of gene expression in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 
      Recent discovery of phage-derived proteins, anti-CRISPRs, which serve to abrogate 
      natural CRISPR anti-phage activity, potentially expands the ability to build 
      synthetic CRISPR-mediated circuits. Here, we characterize a panel of anti-CRISPR 
      molecules for expanded applications to counteract CRISPR-mediated gene activation 
      and repression of reporter and endogenous genes in various cell types. We 
      demonstrate that cells pre-engineered with anti-CRISPR molecules become resistant to 
      gene editing, thus providing a means to generate "write-protected" cells that 
      prevent future gene editing. We further show that anti-CRISPRs can be used to 
      control CRISPR-based gene regulation circuits, including implementation of a pulse 
      generator circuit in mammalian cells. Our work suggests that anti-CRISPR proteins 
      should serve as widely applicable tools for synthetic systems regulating the 
      behavior of eukaryotic cells.

TI  - NGAL as a Potential Target in Tumor Microenvironment.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222212333 [doi]
LID - 12333
AB  - The signaling network between cancer and stromal cells plays a crucial role in tumor 
      microenvironment. The fate of tumor progression mainly depends on the huge amount of 
      information that these cell populations exchange from the onset of neoplastic 
      transformation. Interfering with such signaling has been producing exciting results 
      in cancer therapy: just think of anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that, 
      acting as immune checkpoint inhibitors, interrupt the inhibitory signaling exerted 
      by cancer cells on immune cells or the CAR-T technology that fosters the 
      reactivation of anti-tumoral immunity in a restricted group of leukemias and 
      lymphomas. Nevertheless, many types of cancers, in particular solid tumors, are 
      still refractory to these treatments, so the identification of novel molecular 
      targets in tumor secretome would benefit from implementation of current anti-cancer 
      therapeutical strategies. Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) is a 
      secreted protein abundantly expressed in the secretome of various human tumors. It 
      represents a promising target for the multiple roles that are played inside cancer 
      and stromal cells, and also overall in their cross-talk. The review focuses on the 
      different roles of NGAL in tumor microenvironment and in cancer 
      senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), highlighting the most crucial 
      functions that could be eventually targetable in cancer therapy.

AB  - With the rapid development of DNA synthesis and next-generation sequencing, 
      synthetic biology that aims to standardize, modularize, and innovate cellular 
      functions, has achieved vast progress. Here we review key advances in synthetic 
      biology of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which serves as an important eukaryal 
      model organism and widely applied cell factory. This covers the development of new 
      building blocks, i.e., promoters, terminators and enzymes, pathway engineering, 
      tools developments, and gene circuits utilization. We will also summarize impacts of 
      synthetic biology on both basic and applied biology, and end with further directions 
      for advancing synthetic biology in yeast.

TI  - Integrated mobile genetic elements in Thaumarchaeota.
PG  - 2056-2078
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14564 [doi]
AB  - To explore the diversity of mobile genetic elements (MGE) associated with archaea of 
      the phylum Thaumarchaeota, we exploited the property of most MGE to integrate into 
      the genomes of their hosts. Integrated MGE (iMGE) were identified in 20 
      thaumarchaeal genomes amounting to 2 Mbp of mobile thaumarchaeal DNA. These iMGE 
      group into five major classes: (i) proviruses, (ii) casposons, (iii) insertion 
      sequence-like transposons, (iv) integrative-conjugative elements and (v) cryptic 
      integrated elements. The majority of the iMGE belong to the latter category and 
      might represent novel families of viruses or plasmids. The identified proviruses are 
      related to tailed viruses of the order Caudovirales and to tailless icosahedral 
      viruses with the double jelly-roll capsid proteins. The thaumarchaeal iMGE are all 
      connected within a gene sharing network, highlighting pervasive gene exchange 
      between MGE occupying the same ecological niche. The thaumarchaeal mobilome carries 
      multiple auxiliary metabolic genes, including multicopper oxidases and ammonia 
      monooxygenase subunit C (AmoC), and stress response genes, such as those for 
      universal stress response proteins (UspA). Thus, iMGE might make important 
      contributions to the fitness and adaptation of their hosts. We identified several 
      iMGE carrying type I-B CRISPR-Cas systems and spacers matching other thaumarchaeal 
      iMGE, suggesting antagonistic interactions between coexisting MGE and symbiotic 
      relationships with the ir archaeal hosts.

AB  - Self-propagating drive systems are capable of causing non-Mendelian inheritance. 
      Here, we report a drive system in yeast referred to as a chromosome drive that 
      eliminates the target chromosome via CRISPR-Cas9, enabling the transmission of the 
      desired chromosome. Our results show that the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      chromosome can be eliminated efficiently through only one double-strand break around 
      the centromere via CRISPR-Cas9. As a proof-of-concept experiment of this CRISPR-Cas9 
      chromosome drive system, the synthetic yeast chromosome X is completely eliminated, 
      and the counterpart wild-type chromosome X harboring a green fluorescent protein 
      gene or the components of a synthetic violacein pathway are duplicated by sexual 
      reproduction. We also demonstrate the use of chromosome drive to preferentially 
      transmit complex genetic traits in yeast. Chromosome drive enables entire chromosome 
      elimination and biased inheritance on a chromosomal scale, facilitating genomic 
      engineering and chromosome-scale genetic mapping, and extending applications of 
      self-propagating drives.

      Metabolism to Genome Engineering.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18105228 [doi]
LID - 5228
AB  - Extremophiles are microorganisms that populate habitats considered inhospitable from 
      an anthropocentric point of view and are able to tolerate harsh conditions such as 
      high temperatures, extreme pHs, high concentrations of salts, toxic organic 
      substances, and/or heavy metals. These microorganisms have been broadly studied in 
      the last 30 years and represent precious sources of biomolecules and bioprocesses 
      for many biotechnological applications; in this context, scientific efforts have 
      been focused on the employment of extremophilic microbes and their metabolic 
      pathways to develop biomonitoring and bioremediation strategies to face 
      environmental pollution, as well as to improve biorefineries for the conversion of 
      biomasses into various chemical compounds. This review gives an overview on the 
      peculiar metabolic features of certain extremophilic microorganisms, with a main 
      focus on thermophiles, which make them attractive for biotechnological applications 
      in the field of environmental remediation; moreover, it sheds light on updated 
      genetic systems (also those based on the CRISPR-Cas tool), which expand the 
      potentialities of these microorganisms to be genetically manipulated for various 
      biotechnological purposes.

AB  - The control of gene expression in cells and organisms allows to unveil gene to 
      function relationships and to reprogram biological responses. Several systems, such 
      as Zinc fingers, TALE (Transcription activator-like effectors), and siRNAs 
      (small-interfering RNAs), have been exploited to achieve this. However, recent 
      advances in Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and Cas9 
      (CRISPR-Cas9) have overshadowed them due to high specificity, compatibility with 
      many different organisms, and design flexibility. In this review we summarize 
      state-of-the art for CRISPR-Cas9 technology for large scale gene perturbation 
      studies, including single gene and multiple genes knock-out, knock-down, knock-up 
      libraries, and their associated screening assays. We feature in particular the 
      combination of these methods with single-cell transcriptomics approaches. Finally, 
      we highlight the application of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in building synthetic circuits 
      that can be interfaced with gene networks to control cellular states.

TI  - Minimized combinatorial CRISPR screens identify genetic interactions in autophagy.

AB  - Combinatorial CRISPR-Cas screens have advanced the mapping of genetic interactions, 
      but their experimental scale limits the number of targetable gene combinations. 
      Here, we describe 3Cs multiplexing, a rapid and scalable method to generate highly 
      diverse and uniformly distributed combinatorial CRISPR libraries. We demonstrate 
      that the library distribution skew is the critical determinant of its required 
      screening coverage. By circumventing iterative cloning of PCR-amplified 
      oligonucleotides, 3Cs multiplexing facilitates the generation of combinatorial 
      CRISPR libraries with low distribution skews. We show that combinatorial 3Cs 
      libraries can be screened with minimal coverages, reducing associated efforts and 
      costs at least 10-fold. We apply a 3Cs multiplexing library targeting 12,736 
      autophagy gene combinations with 247,032 paired gRNAs in viability and 
      reporter-based enrichment screens. In the viability screen, we identify, among 
      others, the synthetic lethal WDR45B-PIK3R4 and the proliferation-enhancing 
      ATG7-KEAP1 genetic interactions. In the reporter-based screen, we identify over 
      1,570 essential genetic interactions for autophagy flux, including interactions 
      among paralogous genes, namely ATG2A-ATG2B, GABARAP-MAP1LC3B and GABARAP-GABARAPL2. 
      However, we only observe few genetic interactions within paralogous gene families of 
      more than two members, indicating functional compensation between them. This work 
      establishes 3Cs multiplexing as a platform for genetic interaction screens at scale.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats/CRISPR-associated protein)-mediated genome editing has revolutionized 
      fundamental research and plant breeding. Beyond gene editing, CRISPR/Cas systems 
      have been repurposed as a platform for programmable transcriptional regulation. 
      Catalytically inactive Cas variants (dCas), when fused with transcriptional 
      activation domains, allow for specific activation of any target gene in the genome 
      without inducing DNA double-strand breaks. CRISPR activation enables simultaneous 
      activation of multiple genes, holding great promise in the identification of gene 
      regulatory networks and rewiring of metabolic pathways. Here, we describe a simple 
      protocol for constructing a dCas9-mediated multiplexed gene activation system based 
      on the CRISPR-Act3.0 system. The resulting vectors are tested in rice protoplasts. ©

AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and 
      CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins provide microbial adaptive immunity against 
      invading foreign nucleic acids. In type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, the Cas1-Cas2 
      integrase complex and the subtype-specific Csn2 comprise the CRISPR adaptation 
      module, which cooperates with the Cas9 nuclease effector for spacer selection. Here, 
      we report the molecular organization of the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR 
      adaptation module and its interaction with Cas9 via Csn2. We determined the crystal 
      structure of S. pyogenes type II-A Cas2. Chromatographic and calorimetric analyses 
      revealed the stoichiometry and topology of the type II-A adaptation module composed 
      of Cas1, Cas2 and Csn2. We also demonstrated that Cas9 interacts with Csn2 in a 
      direct and stoichiometric manner. Our results reveal a network of molecular 
      interactions among type II-A Cas proteins and highlight the role of Csn2 in 
      coordinating Cas components involved in the adaptation and interference stages of 
      CRISPR-mediated immunity.

TI  - Genome engineering through CRISPR/Cas9 technology in the human germline and 
      pluripotent stem cells.
PG  - 411-9
LID - 10.1093/humupd/dmw005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the recent development of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 genome editing technology, the possibility to 
      genetically manipulate the human germline (gametes and embryos) has become a 
      distinct technical possibility. Although many technical challenges still need to be 
      overcome in order to achieve adequate efficiency and precision of the technology in 
      human embryos, the path leading to genome editing has never been simpler, more 
      affordable, and widespread. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: In this narrative review we 
      seek to understand the possible impact of CRISR/Cas9 technology on human 
      reproduction from the technical and ethical point of view, and suggest a course of 
      action for the scientific community. SEARCH METHODS: This non-systematic review was 
      carried out using Medline articles in English, as well as technical documents from 
      the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and reports in the media. The 
      technical possibilities of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology with regard to human 
      reproduction are analysed based on results obtained in model systems such as large 
      animals and laboratory rodents. Further, the possibility of CRISPR/Cas9 use in the 
      context of human reproduction, to modify embryos, germline cells, and pluripotent 
      stem cells is reviewed based on the authors' expert opinion. Finally, the possible 
      uses and consequences of CRISPR/cas9 gene editing in reproduction are analysed from 
      the ethical point of view. OUTCOMES: We identify critical technical and ethical 
      issues that should deter from employing CRISPR/Cas9 based technologies in human 
      reproduction until they are clarified. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Overcoming the numerous 
      technical limitations currently associated with CRISPR/Cas9 mediated editing of the 
      human germline will depend on intensive research that needs to be transparent and 
      widely disseminated. Rather than a call to a generalized moratorium, or banning, of 
      this type of research, efforts should be placed on establishing an open, 
      international, collaborative and regulated research framework. Equally important, a 
      societal discussion on the risks, benefits, and preferred applications of the new 
      technology, including all relevant stakeholders, is urgently needed and should be 
      promoted, and ultimately guide research priorities in this area.

TI  - CRISPR screening strategies for microRNA target identification.
PG  - 2914-2922
LID - 10.1111/febs.15218 [doi]
AB  - Identifying microRNA (miRNA) target genes remains a major challenge in understanding 
      the roles miRNAs play in gene regulation. Furthermore, understanding which 
      miRNA-target interactions are the most biologically important is even more 
      difficult. We present CRISPR-based strategies to identify essential miRNA binding 
      sites. First, CRISPR knockout screens can easily be adapted to identify genes whose 
      inactivation suppresses miRNA mutant phenotypes. Second, a custom approach to target 
      individual miRNA binding sites via CRISPR can identify sites whose mutation 
      recapitulates miRNA mutant phenotypes. We emphasize that the latter approach 
      requires a readout of mutational profile (rather than single guide RNA abundance) 
      when applied in a negative selection setting. Overall, the advent of CRISPR 
      technology alongside improving empirical means of miRNA target identification will 
      accelerate our dissection of miRNA gene regulatory networks.

AB  - The limited target specificity of CRISPR-Cas nucleases poses a challenge with 
      respect to their application in research and therapy. Here, we present a simple and 
      original strategy to enhance the specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing by 
      coupling Cas9 to artificial inhibitory domains. Applying a combination of 
      mathematical modeling and experiments, we first determined how CRISPR-Cas9 activity 
      profiles relate to Cas9 specificity. We then used artificially weakened anti-CRISPR 
      (Acr) proteins either coexpressed with or directly fused to Cas9 to fine-tune its 
      activity toward selected levels, thereby achieving an effective kinetic insulation 
      of ON- and OFF-target editing events. We demonstrate highly specific genome editing 
      in mammalian cells using diverse single-guide RNAs prone to potent OFF-targeting. 
      Last, we show that our strategy is compatible with different modes of delivery, 
      including transient transfection and adeno-associated viral vectors. Together, we 
      provide a highly versatile approach to reduce CRISPR-Cas OFF-target effects via 
      kinetic insulation.

LID - F1000 Faculty Rev-1853 [pii]

AB  - Eukaryotic cells are precisely "wired" to coordinate changes in external and 
      intracellular signals with corresponding adjustments in the output of complex and 
      often interconnected signaling pathways. These pathways are critical in 
      understanding cellular growth and function, and several experimental trends are 
      emerging with applicability toward more fully describing the composition and 
      topology of eukaryotic signaling networks. In particular, recent studies have 
      implemented CRISPR/Cas-based screens in mouse and human cell lines for genes 
      involved in various cell growth and disease phenotypes. Proteomic methods using mass 
      spectrometry have enabled quantitative and dynamic profiling of protein 
      interactions, revealing previously undiscovered complexes and allele-specific 
      protein interactions. Methods for the single-cell study of protein localization and 
      gene expression have been integrated with computational analyses to provide insight 
      into cell signaling in yeast and metazoans. In this review, we present an overview 
      of exemplary studies using the above approaches, relevant for the analysis of cell 
      signaling and indeed, more broadly, for many modern biological applications.

AB  - Today, environmental pollution is a serious problem, and bioremediation can play an 
      important role in cleaning contaminated sites. Remediation strategies, such as 
      chemical and physical approaches, are not enough to mitigate pollution problems 
      because of the continuous generation of novel recalcitrant pollutants due to 
      anthropogenic activities. Bioremediation using microbes is an eco-friendly and 
      socially acceptable alternative to conventional remediation approaches. Many 
      microbes with a bioremediation potential have been isolated and characterized but, 
      in many cases, cannot completely degrade the targeted pollutant or are ineffective 
      in situations with mixed wastes. This review envisages advances in systems biology 
      (SB), which enables the analysis of microbial behavior at a community level under 
      different environmental stresses. By applying a SB approach, crucial preliminary 
      information can be obtained for metabolic engineering (ME) of microbes for their 
      enhanced bioremediation capabilities. This review also highlights the integrated SB 
      and ME tools and techniques for bioremediation purposes.

AB  - Purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacteria (PNSB) such as Rhodobacter capsulatus 
      serve as a versatile platform for fundamental studies and various biotechnological 
      applications. In this study, we sought to develop the class II RNA-guided 
      CRISPR/Cas12a system from Francisella novicida for genome editing and 
      transcriptional regulation in R. capsulatus. Template-free disruption method 
      mediated by CRISPR/Cas12a reached ˜ 90% editing efficiency when targeting ccoO or 
      nifH gene. When both genes were simultaneously edited, the multiplex editing 
      efficiency reached > 63%. In addition, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using 
      deactivated Cas12a was also evaluated using reporter genes egfp and lacZ, and the 
      transcriptional repression efficiency reached ˜ 80%. In summary, our work represents 
      the first report to develop CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated genome editing and 
      transcriptional regulation in R. capsulatus, which would greatly accelerate 
      PNSB-related researches.

LID - 10.1038/s41564-020-00794-8 [doi]
AB  - Viruses and plasmids (invasive mobile genetic elements (iMGEs)) have important roles 
      in shaping microbial communities, but their dynamic interactions with CRISPR-based 
      immunity remain unresolved. We analysed generation-resolved iMGE-host dynamics 
      spanning one and a half years in a microbial consortium from a biological wastewater 
      treatment plant using integrated meta-omics. We identified 31 bacterial 
      metagenome-assembled genomes encoding complete CRISPR-Cas systems and their 
      corresponding iMGEs. CRISPR-targeted plasmids outnumbered their bacteriophage 
      counterparts by at least fivefold, highlighting the importance of CRISPR-mediated 
      defence against plasmids. Linear modelling of our time-series data revealed that the 
      variation in plasmid abundance over time explained more of the observed community 
      dynamics than phages. Community-scale CRISPR-based plasmid-host and phage-host 
      interaction networks revealed an increase in CRISPR-mediated interactions coinciding 
      with a decrease in the dominant 'Candidatus Microthrix parvicella' population. 
      Protospacers were enriched in sequences targeting genes involved in the transmission 
      of iMGEs. Understanding the factors shaping the fitness of specific populations is 
      necessary to devise control strategies for undesirable species and to predict or 
      explain community-wide phenotypes.

AB  - In today's scenario of global climate change, there is a colossal demand for 
      sustainable industrial processes and enzymes from thermophiles. Plausibly, 
      thermozymes are an important toolkit, as they are known to be polyextremophilic in 
      nature. Small genome size and diverse molecular conformational modifications have 
      been implicated in devising adaptive strategies. Besides, the utilization of 
      chemical technology and gene editing attributions according to mechanical 
      necessities are the additional key factor for efficacious bioprocess development. 
      Microbial thermozymes have been extensively used in waste management, biofuel, food, 
      paper, detergent, medicinal and pharmaceutical industries. To understand the 
      strength of enzymes at higher temperatures different models utilize X-ray structures 
      of thermostable proteins, machine learning calculations, neural networks, but 
      unified adaptive measures are yet to be totally comprehended. The present review 
      provides a recent updates on thermozymes and various interdisciplinary applications 
      including the aspects of thermophiles bioengineering utilizing synthetic biology and 
      gene editing tools.

PG  - 369-385

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the wake of rising energy demands, microalgae have emerged as 
      potential sources of sustainable and renewable carbon-neutral fuels, such as 
      bio-hydrogen and bio-oil. PURPOSE: For rational metabolic engineering, the 
      elucidation of metabolic pathways in fine detail and their manipulation according to 
      requirements is the key to exploiting the use of microalgae. Emergence of 
      site-specific nucleases have revolutionized applied research leading to 
      biotechnological gains. Genome engineering as well as modulation of the endogenous 
      genome with high precision using CRISPR systems is being gradually employed in 
      microalgal research. Further, to optimize and produce better algal platforms, use of 
      systems biology network analysis and integration of omics data is required. This 
      review discusses two important approaches: systems biology and gene editing 
      strategies used on microalgal systems with a focus on biofuel production and 
      sustainable solutions. It also emphasizes that the integration of such systems would 
      contribute and compliment applied research on microalgae. CONCLUSIONS: Recent 
      advances in microalgae are discussed, including systems biology, gene editing 
      approaches in lipid bio-synthesis, and antenna engineering. Lastly, it has been 
      attempted here to showcase how CRISPR/Cas systems are a better editing tool than 
      existing techniques that can be utilized for gene modulation and engineering during 
      biofuel production.

TI  - AcrHub: an integrative hub for investigating, predicting and mapping anti-CRISPR 
      proteins.
PG  - D630-D638
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa951 [doi]
AB  - Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins naturally inhibit CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems 
      across bacterial and archaeal domains of life. This emerging field has caused a 
      paradigm shift in the way we think about the CRISPR-Cas system, and promises a 
      number of useful applications from gene editing to phage therapy. As the number of 
      verified and predicted Acrs rapidly expands, few online resources have been 
      developed to deal with this wealth of information. To overcome this shortcoming, we 
      developed AcrHub, an integrative database to provide an all-in-one solution for 
      investigating, predicting and mapping Acr proteins. AcrHub catalogs 339 
      non-redundant experimentally validated Acrs and over 70 000 predicted Acrs extracted 
      from genome sequence data from a diverse range of prokaryotic organisms and their 
      viruses. It integrates state-of-the-art predictors to predict potential Acrs, and 
      incorporates three analytical modules: similarity analysis, phylogenetic analysis 
      and homology network analysis, to analyze their relationships with known Acrs. By 
      interconnecting all modules as a platform, AcrHub presents enriched and in-depth 
      analysis of known and potential Acrs and therefore provides new and exciting 
      insights into the future of Acr discovery and validation. AcrHub is freely available 
      at http://pacrispr.erc.monash.edu/AcrHub/.

TI  - Modulating signaling networks by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transposable element 
      insertion.
PG  - 405-412
LID - 10.1007/s00294-017-0765-9 [doi]
AB  - In a recent past, transposable elements (TEs) were referred to as selfish genetic 
      components only capable of copying themselves with the aim of increasing the odds of 
      being inherited. Nonetheless, TEs have been initially proposed as positive control 
      elements acting in synergy with the host. Nowadays, it is well known that TE 
      movement into host genome comprises an important evolutionary mechanism capable of 
      increasing the adaptive fitness. As insights into TE functioning are increasing day 
      to day, the manipulation of transposition has raised an interesting possibility of 
      setting the host functions, although the lack of appropriate genome engineering 
      tools has unpaved it. Fortunately, the emergence of genome editing technologies 
      based on programmable nucleases, and especially the arrival of a multipurpose 
      RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease system, has made it possible to reconsider this 
      challenge. For such purpose, a particular type of transposons referred to as 
      miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) has shown a series of 
      interesting characteristics for designing functional drivers. Here, recent insights 
      into MITE elements and versatile RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering system 
      are given to understand how to deploy the potential of TEs for control of the host 
      transcriptional activity.

TI  - Designing Biological Circuits: Synthetic Biology Within the Operon Model and Beyond.
PG  - 221-244
LID - 10.1146/annurev-biochem-013118-111914 [doi]
AB  - In 1961, Jacob and Monod proposed the operon model of gene regulation. At the 
      model's core was the modular assembly of regulators, operators, and structural 
      genes. To illustrate the composability of these elements, Jacob and Monod linked 
      phenotypic diversity to the architectures of regulatory circuits. In this review, we 
      examine how the circuit blueprints imagined by Jacob and Monod laid the foundation 
      for the first synthetic gene networks that launched the field of synthetic biology 
      in 2000. We discuss the influences of the operon model and its broader theoretical 
      framework on the first generation of synthetic biological circuits, which were 
      predominantly transcriptional and posttranscriptional circuits. We also describe how 
      recent advances in molecular biology beyond the operon model-namely, programmable 
      DNA- and RNA-binding molecules as well as models of epigenetic and posttranslational

PG  - i656-i663
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty554 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: The prediction of off-target mutations in CRISPR-Cas9 is a hot topic due 
      to its relevance to gene editing research. Existing prediction methods have been 
      developed; however, most of them just calculated scores based on mismatches to the 
      guide sequence in CRISPR-Cas9. Therefore, the existing prediction methods are unable 
      to scale and improve their performance with the rapid expansion of experimental data 
      in CRISPR-Cas9. Moreover, the existing methods still cannot satisfy enough precision 
      in off-target predictions for gene editing at the clinical level. RESULTS: To 
      address it, we design and implement two algorithms using deep neural networks to 
      predict off-target mutations in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (i.e. deep convolutional 
      neural network and deep feedforward neural network). The models were trained and 
      tested on the recently released off-target dataset, CRISPOR dataset, for performance 
      benchmark. Another off-target dataset identified by GUIDE-seq was adopted for 
      additional evaluation. We demonstrate that convolutional neural network achieves the 
      best performance on CRISPOR dataset, yielding an average classification area under 
      the ROC curve (AUC) of 97.2% under stratified 5-fold cross-validation. 
      Interestingly, the deep feedforward neural network can also be competitive at the 
      average AUC of 97.0% under the same setting. We compare the two deep neural network 
      models with the state-of-the-art off-target prediction methods (i.e. CFD, MIT, 
      CROP-IT, and CCTop) and three traditional machine learning models (i.e. random 
      forest, gradient boosting trees, and logistic regression) on both datasets in terms 
      of AUC values, demonstrating the competitive edges of the proposed algorithms. 
      Additional analyses are conducted to investigate the underlying reasons from 
      different perspectives. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The example code are 
      available at https://github.com/MichaelLinn/off_target_prediction. The related 
      datasets are available at 
      https://github.com/MichaelLinn/off_target_prediction/tree/master/data.

TI  - Regulatory RNAs in the Less Studied Streptococcal Species: From Nomenclature to 
      Identification.
PG  - 1161
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01161 [doi]
LID - 1161
AB  - Streptococcal species are Gram-positive bacteria involved in severe and invasive 
      diseases in humans and animals. Although, this group includes different pathogenic 
      species involved in life-threatening infections for humans, it also includes 
      beneficial species, such as Streptococcus thermophilus, which is used in yogurt 
      production. In bacteria virulence factors are controlled by various regulatory 
      networks including regulatory RNAs. For clearness and to develop logical thinking, 
      we start this review with a revision of regulatory RNAs nomenclature. Previous 
      reviews are mostly dealing with Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      regulatory RNAs. We especially focused our analysis on regulatory RNAs in 
      Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus thermophilus and other 
      less studied Streptococcus species. Although, S. agalactiae RNome remains largely 
      unknown, sRNAs (small RNAs) are supposed to mediate regulation during environmental 
      adaptation and host infection. In the case of S. mutans, sRNAs are suggested to be 
      involved in competence regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, and Toxin-Antitoxin 
      systems. A new category of miRNA-size small RNAs (msRNAs) was also identified for 
      the first time in this species. The analysis of S. thermophilus sRNome shows that 
      many sRNAs are associated to the bacterial immune system known as CRISPR-Cas system. 
      Only few of the other different Streptococcus species have been the subject of 
      studies pointed toward the characterization of regulatory RNAs. Finally, 
      understanding bacterial sRNome can constitute one step forward to the elaboration of 
      new strategies in therapy such as substitution of antibiotics in the management of 
      S. agalactiae neonatal infections, prevention of S. mutans dental caries or use of 
      S. thermophilus CRISPR-Cas system in genome editing applications.

AB  - Target RNA binding to crRNA-bound type III-A CRISPR-Cas multi-subunit Csm 
      surveillance complexes activates cyclic-oligoadenylate (cA(n)) formation from ATP 
      subunits positioned within the composite pair of Palm domain pockets of the Csm1 
      subunit. The generated cA(n) second messenger in turn targets the CARF domain of 
      trans-acting RNase Csm6, triggering its HEPN domain-based RNase activity. We have 
      undertaken cryo-EM studies on multi-subunit Thermococcus onnurineus Csm effector 
      ternary complexes, as well as X-ray studies on Csm1-Csm4 cassette, both bound to 
      substrate (AMPPNP), intermediates (pppA(n)), and products (cA(n)), to decipher 
      mechanistic aspects of cA(n) formation and release. A network of intermolecular 
      hydrogen bond alignments accounts for the observed adenosine specificity, with 
      ligand positioning dictating formation of linear pppA(n) intermediates and 
      subsequent cA(n) formation by cyclization. We combine our structural results with 
      published functional studies to highlight mechanistic insights into the role of the 
      Csm effector complex in mediating the cA(n) signaling pathway.

TI  - High-Yielding Terpene-Based Biofuel Production in Rhodobacter capsulatus.
PG  - 1545-1552
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00146 [doi]
AB  - Energy crisis and global climate change have driven an increased effort toward 
      biofuel synthesis from renewable feedstocks. Herein, purple nonsulfur photosynthetic 
      bacterium (PNSB) of Rhodobacter capsulatus was explored as a platform for high-titer 
      production of a terpene-based advanced biofuel-bisabolene. A multilevel engineering 
      strategy such as promoter screening, improving the NADPH availability, strengthening 
      the precursor supply, suppressing the side pathways, and introducing a heterologous 
      mevalonate pathway, was used to improve the bisabolene titer in R. capsulatus. The 
      above strategies enabled a 35-fold higher titer of bisabolene than that of the 
      starting strain, reaching 1089.7 mg/L from glucose in a shake flask. The engineered 
      strain produced 9.8 g/L bisabolene with a yield of >0.196 g/g-glucose under the 
      two-phase fed-batch fermentation, which corresponds to >78% of theoretical maximum. 
      Taken together, our work represents one of the pioneering studies to demonstrate 
      PNSB as a promising platform for terpene-based advanced biofuel production.

AB  - Gene expression control based on CRISPRi (clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeats interference) has emerged as a powerful tool for creating 
      synthetic gene circuits, both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes; yet, its lack of 
      cooperativity has been pointed out as a potential obstacle for dynamic or 
      multistable synthetic circuit construction. Here we use CRISPRi to build a synthetic 
      oscillator ("CRISPRlator"), bistable network (toggle switch) and stripe 
      pattern-forming incoherent feed-forward loop (IFFL). Our circuit designs, conceived 
      to feature high predictability and orthogonality, as well as low metabolic burden 
      and context-dependency, allow us to achieve robust circuit behaviors in Escherichia 
      coli populations. Mathematical modeling suggests that unspecific binding in CRISPRi 
      is essential to establish multistability. Our work demonstrates the wide 
      applicability of CRISPRi in synthetic circuits and paves the way for future efforts 
      towards engineering more complex synthetic networks, boosted by the advantages of 
      CRISPR technology.

AB  - Using CRISPR-based genome-editing techniques, we are able to generate a variety of 
      new mouse models of several types of diseases. These animal models will be 
      instrumental not only for enabling the comprehension of a particular disease and its 
      underlying molecular mechanism but also as unique recipients for testing novel and 
      innovative therapeutic approaches that are being currently explored. This chapter 
      describes detailed step-by-step protocols, reagents, and equipment required for 
      successful generation of genome-edited mice using CRISPR tools.

TI  - Generation of WNK1 knockout cell lines by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing.
PG  - F366-76
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00612.2014 [doi]
AB  - Sodium-coupled SLC12 cation chloride cotransporters play important roles in cell 
      volume and chloride homeostasis, epithelial fluid secretion, and renal tubular salt 
      reabsorption. These cotransporters are phosphorylated and activated indirectly by 
      With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinases through their downstream effector kinases, Ste20- and 
      SPS1-related proline alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress-responsive 
      kinase 1 (OSR1). Multiple WNK kinases can coexist within a single cell type, 
      although their relative contributions to SPAK/OSR1 activation and salt transport 
      remain incompletely understood. Deletion of specific WNKs from cells that natively 
      express a functional WNK-SPAK/OSR1 network will help resolve these knowledge gaps. 
      Here, we outline a simple method to selectively knock out full-length WNK1 
      expression from mammalian cells using RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats/Cas9 endonucleases. Two clonal cell lines were generated 
      by using a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the WNK1 gene, which 
      produced indels that abolished WNK1 protein expression. Both cell lines exhibited 
      reduced endogenous WNK4 protein abundance, indicating that WNK1 is required for WNK4 
      stability. Consistent with an on-target effect, the reduced WNK4 abundance was 
      associated with increased expression of the KLHL3/cullin-3 E3 ubiquitin ligase 
      complex and was rescued by exogenous WNK1 overexpression. Although the morphology of 
      the knockout cells was indistinguishable from control, they exhibited low baseline 
      SPAK/OSR1 activity and failed to trigger regulatory volume increase after hypertonic 
      stress, confirming an essential role for WNK1 in cell volume regulation. 
      Collectively, our data show how this new, powerful, and accessible gene-editing 
      technology can be used to dissect and analyze WNK signaling networks.

AB  - Gene expression changes, the driving forces for cellular diversity in multicellular 
      organisms, are regulated by a diverse set of gene regulatory elements that direct 
      transcription in specific cells. Mutations in these elements, ranging from 
      chromosomal aberrations to single-nucleotide polymorphisms, are a major cause of 
      human disease. However, we currently have a very limited understanding of how 
      regulatory element genotypes lead to specific phenotypes. In this review, we discuss 
      the various methods of regulatory element identification, the different types of 
      mutations they harbor, and their impact on human disease. We highlight how these 
      variations can affect transcription of multiple genes in gene regulatory networks. 
      In addition, we describe how novel technologies, such as massively parallel reporter 
      assays and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, are beginning to provide a better 
      understanding of the functional roles that these elements have and how their 
      alteration can lead to specific phenotypes.

AB  - T-cell-based cancer immunotherapies have emerged as a promising approach for cancer 
      treatment, highlighting the importance of understanding the regulation of T-cell 
      function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying T-cell activation are not 
      fully understood. The CRISPR/Cas9 system can serve as a robust method to 
      systematically study signaling pathways. In this chapter, we describe details of 
      using the CRISPR screen to identify regulators in TCR signaling, from the sgRNA 
      library construction to genomic DNA sequencing. We also add some notes to further 
      help readers performing the CRISPR screen. This approach can be readily adapted to 
      study the activation of other immune cells, including B cells and dendritic cells.

      Genes.
PG  - 61-71
LID - 10.1007/s10911-018-9418-y [doi]
AB  - The de novo formation of milk-secreting mammary epithelium during pregnancy is 
      regulated by prolactin through activation of the transcription factor STAT5, which 
      stimulates the expression of several hundred mammary-specific genes. In addition to 
      its key role in activating gene expression in mammary tissue, STAT5, which is 
      ubiquitously expressed in most cell types, implements T cell-specific programs 
      controlled by interleukins. However, the mechanisms by which STAT5 controls 
      cell-specific genetic programs activated by distinct cytokines remain relatively 
      unknown. Integration of data from genome-wide surveys of chromatin markers and 
      transcription factor binding at regulatory elements may shed light on the mechanisms 
      that drive cell-specific programs. Here, we have illustrated how STAT5 controls 
      cell-specific gene expression through its concentration and an auto-regulatory 
      enhancer supporting its high levels in mammary tissue. The unique genomic features 
      of STAT5-driven enhancers or super-enhancers that regulate mammary-specific genes 
      and their dynamic remodeling in response to pregnancy hormone levels are described. 
      We have further provided biological evidence supporting the in vivo function of a 
      STAT5-driven super-enhancer with the aid of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Finally, we 
      discuss how the functions of mammary-specific super-enhancers are confined by the 
      zinc finger protein, CTCF, to allow exclusive activation of mammary-specific genes 
      without affecting common neighboring genes. This review comprehensively summarizes 
      the molecular pathways underlying differential control of cell-specific gene sets by 
      STAT5 and provides novel insights into STAT5-dependent mammary physiology.

AB  - Design and construction of an optimal microbial cell factory typically requires 
      overexpression, knockdown, and knockout of multiple gene targets. In this chapter, 
      we describe a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy utilizing an orthogonal 
      trifunctional CRISPR system that combines transcriptional activation, 
      transcriptional interference, and gene deletion (CRISPR-AID) in the yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This strategy enables multiplexed perturbation of the 
      metabolic and regulatory networks in a modular, parallel, and high-throughput 
      manner. To implement this system, three orthogonal Cas proteins were utilized: 
      dLbCpf1 fused to a transcriptional activator, dSpCas9 fused to a transcriptional 
      repressor, and SaCas9 for gene deletion. Deletion was accomplished by the 
      introduction of a 28bp frame-shift mutation using a homology donor on the guide RNA 
      expression vector. This approach enables the application of metabolic engineering to 
      systematically optimize phenotypes of interest through a combination of gain-, 
      reduction-, and loss-of-function mutations. Finally, we describe the construction of 
      the CRISPR-AID system and its application toward engineering an example phenotype, 
      surface display of recombinant Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II.

TI  - Tunable and multifunctional eukaryotic transcription factors based on CRISPR/Cas.
PG  - 604-13
LID - 10.1021/sb400081r [doi]
AB  - Transcriptional regulation is central to the complex behavior of natural biological 
      systems and synthetic gene circuits. Platforms for the scalable, tunable, and simple 
      modulation of transcription would enable new abilities to study natural systems and 
      implement artificial capabilities in living cells. Previous approaches to synthetic 
      transcriptional regulation have relied on engineering DNA-binding proteins, which 
      necessitate multistep processes for construction and optimization of function. Here, 
      we show that the CRISPR/Cas system of Streptococcus pyogenes can be programmed to 
      direct both activation and repression to natural and artificial eukaryotic promoters 
      through the simple engineering of guide RNAs with base-pairing complementarity to 
      target DNA sites. We demonstrate that the activity of CRISPR-based transcription 
      factors (crisprTFs) can be tuned by directing multiple crisprTFs to different 
      positions in natural promoters and by arraying multiple crisprTF-binding sites in 
      the context of synthetic promoters in yeast and human cells. Furthermore, externally 
      controllable regulatory modules can be engineered by layering gRNAs with small 
      molecule-responsive proteins. Additionally, single nucleotide substitutions within 
      promoters are sufficient to render them orthogonal with respect to the same 
      gRNA-guided crisprTF. We envision that CRISPR-based eukaryotic gene regulation will 
      enable the facile construction of scalable synthetic gene circuits and open up new 
      approaches for mapping natural gene networks and their effects on complex cellular 
      phenotypes.

TI  - Dissecting Tissue-Specific Super-Enhancers by Integrating Genome-Wide Analyses and 
      CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing.
PG  - 47-59
LID - 10.1007/s10911-018-9417-z [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in genome-wide sequencing technologies have provided researchers 
      with unprecedented opportunities to discover the genomic structures of gene 
      regulatory units in living organisms. In particular, the integration of ChIP-seq, 
      RNA-seq, and DNase-seq techniques has facilitated the mapping of a new class of 
      regulatory elements. These elements, called super-enhancers, can regulate 
      cell-type-specific gene sets and even fine-tune gene expression regulation in 
      response to external stimuli, and have become a hot topic in genome biology. 
      However, there is scant genetic evidence demonstrating their unique biological 
      relevance and the mechanisms underlying these biological functions. In this review, 
      we describe a robust genome-wide strategy for mapping cell-type-specific enhancers 
      or super-enhancers in the mammary genome. In this strategy, genome-wide screening of 
      active enhancer clusters that are co-occupied by mammary-enriched transcription 
      factors, co-factors, and active enhancer marks is used to identify bona fide mammary 
      tissue-specific super-enhancers. The in vivo function of these super-enhancers and 
      their associated regulatory elements may then be investigated in various ways using 
      the advanced CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology. Based on our experience 
      targeting various mammary genomic sites using CRISPR/Cas9 in mice, we 
      comprehensively discuss the molecular consequences of the different targeting 
      methods, such as the number of gRNAs and the dependence on their simultaneous or 
      sequential injections. We also mention the considerations that are essential for 
      obtaining accurate results and shed light on recent progress that has been made in 
      developing modified CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing techniques. In the future, the 
      coupling of advanced genome-wide sequencing and genome-editing technologies could 
      provide new insights into the complex genetic regulatory networks involved in 
      mammary-gland development.

TI  - Oncogenic MYC amplifies mitotic perturbations.
PG  - 190136
LID - 10.1098/rsob.190136 [doi]
LID - 190136
AB  - The oncogenic transcription factor MYC modulates vast arrays of genes, thereby 
      influencing numerous biological pathways including biogenesis, metabolism, 
      proliferation, apoptosis and pluripotency. When deregulated, MYC drives genomic 
      instability via several mechanisms including aberrant proliferation, replication 
      stress and ROS production. Deregulated MYC also promotes chromosome instability, but 
      less is known about how MYC influences mitosis. Here, we show that deregulating MYC 
      modulates multiple aspects of mitotic chromosome segregation. Cells overexpressing 
      MYC have altered spindle morphology, take longer to align their chromosomes at 
      metaphase and enter anaphase sooner. When challenged with a variety of anti-mitotic 
      drugs, cells overexpressing MYC display more anomalies, the net effect of which is 
      increased micronuclei, a hallmark of chromosome instability. Proteomic analysis 
      showed that MYC modulates multiple networks predicted to influence mitosis, with the 
      mitotic kinase PLK1 identified as a central hub. In turn, we show that MYC modulates 
      several PLK1-dependent processes, namely mitotic entry, spindle assembly and SAC 
      satisfaction. These observations thus underpin the pervasive nature of oncogenic MYC 
      and provide a mechanistic rationale for MYC's ability to drive chromosome 
      instability.

AB  - Virophages are satellite DNA viruses that depend for their replication on giant 
      viruses of the family Mimiviridae. An evolutionary relationship exists between the 
      virophages and Polintons, large self-synthesizing transposons that are wide spread 
      in the genomes of diverse eukaryotes. Most of the Polintons encode homologs of major 
      and minor icosahedral virus capsid proteins and accordingly are predicted to form 
      virions. Additionally, metagenome analysis has led to the discovery of an expansive 
      family of Polinton-like viruses (PLV) that are more distantly related to bona fide 
      Polintons and virophages. Another group of giant virus parasites includes small, 
      linear, double-stranded DNA elements called transpovirons. Recent in-depth 
      comparative genomic analysis has yielded evidence of the origin of the PLV and the 
      transpovirons from Polintons. Integration of virophage genomes into genomes of both 
      giant viruses and protists has been demonstrated. Furthermore, in an experimental 
      coinfection system that consisted of a protist host, a giant virus and an associated 
      virophage, the virophage integrated into the host genome and, after activation of 
      its expression by a superinfecting giant virus, served as an agent of adaptive 
      immunity. There is a striking analogy between this mechanism and the CRISPR-Cas 
      system of prokaryotic adaptive immunity. Taken together, these findings show that 
      Polintons, PLV, virophages and transpovirons form a dynamic network of integrating 
      mobile genetic elements that contribute to the cellular antivirus defense and 
      host-virus coevolution.

AB  - Ocular lens development represents an advantageous system in which to study 
      regulatory mechanisms governing cell fate decisions, extracellular signaling, cell 
      and tissue organization, and the underlying gene regulatory networks. 
      Spatiotemporally regulated domains of BMP, FGF, and other signaling molecules in 
      late gastrula-early neurula stage embryos generate the border region between the 
      neural plate and non-neural ectoderm from which multiple cell types, including lens 
      progenitor cells, emerge and undergo initial tissue formation. Extracellular 
      signaling and DNA-binding transcription factors govern lens and optic cup 
      morphogenesis. Pax6, c-Maf, Hsf4, Prox1, Sox1, and a few additional factors regulate 
      the expression of the lens structural proteins, the crystallins. Extensive crosstalk 
      between a diverse array of signaling pathways controls the complexity and order of 
      lens morphogenetic processes and lens transparency.

TI  - Applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in the Mammalian Central Nervous System.
PG  - 567-581
AB  - Within the central nervous system, gene regulatory mechanisms are crucial regulators 
      of cellular development and function, and dysregulation of these systems is commonly 
      observed in major neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. However, due to a 
      lack of tools to specifically modulate the genome and epigenome in the central 
      nervous system, many molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying cognitive function 
      and behavior are still unknown. Although genome editing tools have been around for 
      decades, the recent emergence of inexpensive, straightforward, and widely accessible 
      CRISPR/Cas9 systems has led to a revolution in gene editing. The development of the 
      catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) expanded this flexibility even further by acting as 
      an anchoring system for fused effector proteins, structural scaffolds, and RNAs. 
      Together, these advances have enabled robust, modular approaches for specific 
      targeting and modification of the local chromatin environment at a single gene. This 
      review highlights these advancements and how the combination of powerful modulatory 
      tools paired with the versatility of CRISPR-Cas9-based systems offer great potential 
      for understanding the underlying genetic and epigenetic contributions of neuronal 
      function, behavior, and neurobiological diseases.

TI  - SCNrank: spectral clustering for network-based ranking to reveal potential drug 
      targets and its application in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s12920-020-0681-6 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common pancreatic 
      malignancy. Due to its wide heterogeneity, PDAC acts aggressively and responds 
      poorly to most chemotherapies, causing an urgent need for the development of new 
      therapeutic strategies. Cell lines have been used as the foundation for drug 
      development and disease modeling. CRISPR-Cas9 plays a key role in every step-in drug 
      discovery: from target identification and validation to preclinical cancer cell 
      testing. Using cell-line models and CRISPR-Cas9 technology together make drug target 
      prediction feasible. However, there is still a large gap between predicted results 
      and actionable targets in real tumors. Biological network models provide great modus 
      to mimic genetic interactions in real biological systems, which can benefit gene 
      perturbation studies and potential target identification for treating PDAC. 
      Nevertheless, building a network model that takes cell-line data and CRISPR-Cas9 
      data as input to accurately predict potential targets that will respond well on real 
      tissue remains unsolved. METHODS: We developed a novel algorithm 'Spectral 
      Clustering for Network-based target Ranking' (SCNrank) that systematically 
      integrates three types of data: expression profiles from tumor tissue, normal tissue 
      and cell-line PDAC; protein-protein interaction network (PPI); and CRISPR-Cas9 data 
      to prioritize potential drug targets for PDAC. The whole algorithm can be classified 
      into three steps: 1. using STRING PPI network skeleton, SCNrank constructs 
      tissue-specific networks with PDAC tumor and normal pancreas tissues from expression 
      profiles; 2. With the same network skeleton, SCNrank constructs cell-line-specific 
      networks using the cell-line PDAC expression profiles and CRISPR-Cas 9 data from 
      pancreatic cancer cell-lines; 3. SCNrank applies a novel spectral clustering 
      approach to reduce data dimension and generate gene clusters that carry common 
      features from both networks. Finally, SCNrank applies a scoring scheme called 
      'Target Influence score' (TI), which estimates a given target's influence towards 
      the cluster it belongs to, for scoring and ranking each drug target. RESULTS: We 
      applied SCNrank to analyze 263 expression profiles, CRPSPR-Cas9 data from 22 
      different pancreatic cancer cell-lines and the STRING protein-protein interaction 
      (PPI) network. With SCNrank, we successfully constructed an integrated tissue PDAC 
      network and an integrated cell-line PDAC network, both of which contain 4414 
      selected genes that are overexpressed in tumor tissue samples. After clustering, 
      4414 genes are distributed into 198 clusters, which include 367 targets of FDA 
      approved drugs. These drug targets are all scored and ranked by their TI scores, 
      which we defined to measure their influence towards the network. We validated 
      top-ranked targets in three aspects: Firstly, mapping them onto the existing 
      clinical drug targets of PDAC to measure the concordance. Secondly, we performed 
      enrichment analysis to these drug targets and the clusters there are within, to 
      reveal functional associations between clusters and PDAC; Thirdly, we performed 
      survival analysis for the top-ranked targets to connect targets with clinical 
      outcomes. Survival analysis reveals that overexpression of three top-ranked genes, 
      PGK1, HMMR and POLE2, significantly increases the risk of death in PDAC patients. 
      CONCLUSION: SCNrank is an unbiased algorithm that systematically integrates multiple 
      types of omics data to do potential drug target selection and ranking. SCNrank shows 
      great capability in predicting drug targets for PDAC. Pancreatic cancer-associated 
      gene candidates predicted by our SCNrank approach have the potential to guide 
      genetics-based anti-pancreatic drug discovery.

AB  - For more than 40 years, scientists have been developing tools and technologies for 
      genome modification; however, initial progress was slow and few outside of the 
      molecular biology community took an interest in the field. Everything has 
      dramatically changed with the recent appearance of the so-called precision 
      approaches, and especially with the 'CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 
      Palindromic Repeat) revolution'. With great powers come great responsibilities. 
      CRISPR-derived technologies have been proven efficient, cheap, rather easy and fast, 
      and provided universal access to genome modification techniques beyond the leading 
      research centers and reference laboratories. The popularization of techniques to 
      manipulate the human genome and that of all other living beings consequently raises 
      many essential questions, on the ethical and legal sides, both for the scientific 
      community and the lay public. In order to mitigate excessive hype and concern among 
      citizens, a call for the mobilization of the various stakeholders is now urgent 
      through a global governance of genome editing.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas transcriptional circuits hold great promise as platforms for engineering 
      metabolic networks and information processing circuits. Historically, prokaryotic 
      CRISPR control systems have been limited to CRISPRi. Creating approaches to 
      integrate CRISPRa for transcriptional activation with existing CRISPRi-based systems 
      would greatly expand CRISPR circuit design space. Here, we develop design principles 
      for engineering prokaryotic CRISPRa/i genetic circuits with network topologies 
      specified by guide RNAs. We demonstrate that multi-layer CRISPRa/i cascades and 
      feedforward loops can operate through the regulated expression of guide RNAs in 
      cell-free expression systems and E. coli. We show that CRISPRa/i circuits can 
      program complex functions by designing type 1 incoherent feedforward loops acting as 
      fold-change detectors and tunable pulse-generators. By investigating how component 
      characteristics relate to network properties such as depth, width, and speed, this 
      work establishes a framework for building scalable CRISPRa/i circuits as regulatory 
      programs in cell-free expression systems and bacterial hosts. A record of this 
      paper's transparent peer review process is included in the supplemental information.

AB  - CRISPR systems have greatly promoted research in genome editing and transcriptional 
      regulation. CRISPR-based transcriptional repression and activation systems will be 
      valuable for applications in engineering plant immunity, boosting metabolic 
      production, and enhancing our knowledge of gene regulatory networks. Multiplexing of 
      CRISPR allows multiple genes to be targeted without significant additional effort. 
      Here, we describe our CRISPR-Act2.0 system which is an improved multiplexing 
      transcriptional activation system in plants.

AB  - Genomic editing technologies are developing rapidly, promising significant 
      developments for biomedicine, agriculture and other fields. In the present 
      investigation, we analyzed and compared the process of innovation for six genomic 
      technologies: viral vectors, RNAi, TALENs, meganucleases, ZFNs and CRISPR/Cas 
      including the profile of the main research institutions and their funders, to 
      understand how innovation evolved and what institutions influenced research 
      trajectories. A Web of Science search of papers on viral vectors RNAi, CRISPR/Cas, 
      TALENs, ZFNs and meganucleases was used to build a citation network of 16,746 
      papers. An analysis of network clustering combined with text mining was performed. 
      For viral vectors, a long-term process of incremental innovation was identified, 
      which was largely publicly funded in the United States and the European Union. The 
      trajectory of RNAi research included clusters related to the study of RNAi as a 
      biological phenomenon and its use in functional genomics, biomedicine and pest 
      control. A British philanthropic organization and a US pharmaceutical company played 
      a key role in the development of basic RNAi research and clinical application 
      respectively, in addition to government and academic institutions. In the case of 
      CRISPR/Cas research, basic science discoveries led to the technical improvements, 
      and these two in turn provided the information required for the development of 
      biomedical, agricultural, livestock and industrial applications. The trajectory of 
      CRISPR/Cas research exhibits a geopolitical division of the investigation efforts 
      between the US, as the main producer and funder of basic research and technical 
      improvements, and Chinese research institutions increasingly leading applied 
      research. Our results reflect a change in the model for financing science, with 
      reduced public financing for basic science and applied research on publicly funded 
      technological developments in the US, and the emergence of China as a scientific 
      superpower, with implications for the development of applications of genomic 
      technologies.

TI  - FIREWORKS: a bottom-up approach to integrative coessentiality network analysis.
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202000882 [doi]
LID - e202000882
AB  - Genetic coessentiality analysis, a computational approach which identifies genes 
      sharing a common effect on cell fitness across large-scale screening datasets, has 
      emerged as a powerful tool to identify functional relationships between human genes. 
      However, widespread implementation of coessentiality to study individual genes and 
      pathways is limited by systematic biases in existing coessentiality approaches and 
      accessibility barriers for investigators without computational expertise. We created 
      FIREWORKS, a method and interactive tool for the construction and statistical 
      analysis of coessentiality networks centered around gene(s) provided by the user. 
      FIREWORKS incorporates a novel bias reduction approach to reduce false discoveries, 
      enables restriction of coessentiality analyses to custom subsets of cell lines, and 
      integrates multiomic and drug-gene interaction datasets to investigate and target 
      contextual gene essentiality. We demonstrate the broad utility of FIREWORKS through 
      case vignettes investigating gene function and specialization, indirect therapeutic 
      targeting of "undruggable" proteins, and context-specific rewiring of genetic 
      networks.

AB  - This approach is quite promising to control plant viral diseases and create 
      synthetic networks to better understand the structure/function relationship in RNA 
      and proteins. Plant viruses are obligate intracellular parasites which causes 
      enormous losses in crop yield worldwide. These viruses replicate into infected cells 
      by highjacking host cellular machinery. Over the last two decades, diverse 
      approaches such as conventional breeding, transgenic approach and gene silencing 
      strategies have been used to control RNA viruses, but escaped due to high rate of 
      mutation. Recently, a novel CRISPR enzyme, called Cas13a, has been used engineered 
      to confer RNA viruses resistance in plants. Here, we summarize the recent 
      breakthrough of CRISPR/Cas13a and its applications in RNA biology.

TI  - Single molecule network analysis identifies structural changes to caveolae and 
      scaffolds due to mutation of the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain.
PG  - 7810
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-86770-6 [doi]
LID - 7810
AB  - Caveolin-1 (CAV1), the caveolae coat protein, also associates with non-caveolar 
      scaffold domains. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) network analysis 
      distinguishes caveolae and three scaffold domains, hemispherical S2 scaffolds and 
      smaller S1B and S1A scaffolds. The caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD) is a highly 
      conserved hydrophobic region that mediates interaction of CAV1 with multiple 
      effector molecules. F92A/V94A mutation disrupts CSD function, however the structural 
      impact of CSD mutation on caveolae or scaffolds remains unknown. Here, SMLM network 
      analysis quantitatively shows that expression of the CAV1 CSD F92A/V94A mutant in 
      CRISPR/Cas CAV1 knockout MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells reduces the size and volume 
      and enhances the elongation of caveolae and scaffold domains, with more pronounced 
      effects on S2 and S1B scaffolds. Convex hull analysis of the outer surface of the 
      CAV1 point clouds confirms the size reduction of CSD mutant CAV1 blobs and shows 
      that CSD mutation reduces volume variation amongst S2 and S1B CAV1 blobs at 
      increasing shrink values, that may reflect retraction of the CAV1 N-terminus towards 
      the membrane, potentially preventing accessibility of the CSD. Detection of point 
      mutation-induced changes to CAV1 domains highlights the utility of SMLM network 
      analysis for mesoscale structural analysis of oligomers in their native environment.

TI  - FMNL formins boost lamellipodial force generation.
PG  - 14832

AB  - Migration frequently involves Rac-mediated protrusion of lamellipodia, formed by 
      Arp2/3 complex-dependent branching thought to be crucial for force generation and 
      stability of these networks. The formins FMNL2 and FMNL3 are Cdc42 effectors 
      targeting to the lamellipodium tip and shown here to nucleate and elongate actin 
      filaments with complementary activities in vitro. In migrating B16-F1 melanoma 
      cells, both formins contribute to the velocity of lamellipodium protrusion. Loss of 
      FMNL2/3 function in melanoma cells and fibroblasts reduces lamellipodial width, 
      actin filament density and -bundling, without changing patterns of Arp2/3 complex 
      incorporation. Strikingly, in melanoma cells, FMNL2/3 gene inactivation almost 
      completely abolishes protrusion forces exerted by lamellipodia and modifies their 
      ultrastructural organization. Consistently, CRISPR/Cas-mediated depletion of FMNL2/3 
      in fibroblasts reduces both migration and capability of cells to move against 
      viscous media. Together, we conclude that force generation in lamellipodia strongly 
      depends on FMNL formin activity, operating in addition to Arp2/3 complex-dependent 
      filament branching.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CRISPR (Clustered, Regularly, Interspaced, Short, Palindromic Repeats) 
      loci provide prokaryotes with an adaptive immunity against viruses and other mobile 
      genetic elements. CRISPR arrays can be transcribed and processed into small crRNA 
      molecules, which are then used by the cell to target the foreign nucleic acid. Since 
      spacers are accumulated by active CRISPR/Cas systems, the sequences of these spacers 
      provide a record of the past "infection history" of the organism. RESULTS: Here we 
      analyzed all currently known spacers present in archaeal genomes and identified 
      their source by DNA similarity. While nearly 50% of archaeal spacers matched mobile 
      genetic elements, such as plasmids or viruses, several others matched chromosomal 
      genes of other organisms, primarily other archaea. Thus, networks of gene exchange 
      between archaeal species were revealed by the spacer analysis, including many cases 
      of inter-genus and inter-species gene transfer events. Spacers that recognize viral 
      sequences tend to be located further away from the leader sequence, implying that 
      there exists a selective pressure for their retention. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR spacers 
      provide direct evidence for extensive gene exchange in archaea, especially within 
      genera, and support the current dogma where the primary role of the CRISPR/Cas 
      system is anti-viral and anti-plasmid defense. OPEN PEER REVIEW: This article was

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-7125-1_12 [doi]
AB  - Novel tools and methods for regulating in vivo plant gene expression are quickly 
      gaining popularity and utility due to recent advances in CRISPR-dCas9 chimeric 
      effector regulators, otherwise known as CRISPR artificial transcription factors 
      (CRISPR-ATFs). These tools are especially useful for studying gene function and 
      interaction within various regulatory networks. First generation CRISPR-ATFs are 
      nuclease-deactivated (dCas9) CRISPR systems where dCas9 proteins are fused to known 
      transcriptional activator domains (VP64) or repressor domains (SRDX). When multiple 
      chimeric dCas9-effector fusions are guided to gene regulatory regions via CRISPR 
      gRNAs, they can modulate expression of transcript levels in planta. The protocol 
      presented here provides a detailed procedure for activating AtPAP1 and repressing 
      AtCSTF64 in Arabidopsis thaliana. This protocol makes use of our plant CRISPR 
      toolbox to streamline the assembly and cloning of multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 
      transcriptional regulatory constructs.

PG  - 91-108
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-0958-3_7 [doi]
AB  - Knockout CRISPR screening enables the unbiased discovery of genes with a functional 
      role in almost any cellular or molecular process of interest. The approach couples a 
      genome-scale library of guide RNA (gRNA), the Cas9 endonuclease, and a faithful 
      phenotypic read-out to systematically identify candidate genes via their 
      loss-of-function effect. Here we provide a detailed description of the CRISPR screen 
      protocol and outline how to apply it to decipher the gene networks that underlie 
      developmental cell fate decisions. As a paradigm we use the in vitro model of cell 
      state transition(s) from naive pluripotency to primordial germ cell (PGC) fate, 
      exploiting the Stella-GFP:Esg1-tdTomato (SGET) mouse ESC line. The principles in 
      this protocol can be readily adapted to characterize lineage regulators for other 
      cell fate models and/or for other species.

TI  - Rewiring Calcium Signaling for Precise Transcriptional Reprogramming.
PG  - 814-821
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00467 [doi]
AB  - Tools capable of modulating gene expression in living organisms are very useful for 
      interrogating the gene regulatory network and controlling biological processes. The 
      catalytically inactive CRISPR/Cas9 (dCas9), when fused with repressive or activating 
      effectors, functions as a versatile platform to reprogram gene transcription at 
      targeted genomic loci. However, without temporal control, the application of these 
      reprogramming tools will likely cause off-target effects and lack strict 
      reversibility. To overcome this limitation, we report herein the development of a 
      chemical or light-inducible transcriptional reprogramming device that combines 
      photoswitchable genetically encoded calcium actuators with dCas9 to control gene 
      expression. By fusing an engineered Ca(2+)-responsive NFAT fragment with dCas9 and 
      transcriptional coactivators, we harness the power of light to achieve 
      photoinducible transcriptional reprogramming in mammalian cells. This synthetic 
      system (designated CaRROT) can also be used to document calcium-dependent activity 
      in mammals after exposure to ligands or chemicals that would elicit calcium response 
      inside cells.

AB  - Characterizing variability in the extent and nature of responses to environmental 
      exposures is a critical aspect of human health risk assessment. Chemical toxicants 
      act by many different mechanisms, however, and the genes involved in adverse outcome 
      pathways (AOPs) and AOP networks are not yet characterized. Functional genomic 
      approaches can reveal both toxicity pathways and susceptibility genes, through 
      knockdown or knockout of all non-essential genes in a cell of interest, and 
      identification of genes associated with a toxicity phenotype following toxicant 
      exposure. Screening approaches in yeast and human near-haploid leukemic KBM7 cells 
      have identified roles for genes and pathways involved in response to many toxicants 
      but are limited by partial homology among yeast and human genes and limited 
      relevance to normal diploid cells. RNA interference (RNAi) suppresses mRNA 
      expression level but is limited by off-target effects (OTEs) and incomplete 
      knockdown. The recently developed gene editing approach called clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindrome repeats-associated nuclease (CRISPR)-Cas9, can 
      precisely knock-out most regions of the genome at the DNA level with fewer OTEs than 
      RNAi, in multiple human cell types, thus overcoming the limitations of the other 
      approaches. It has been used to identify genes involved in the response to chemical 
      and microbial toxicants in several human cell types and could readily be extended to 
      the systematic screening of large numbers of environmental chemicals. CRISPR-Cas9 
      can also repress and activate gene expression, including that of non-coding RNA, 
      with near-saturation, thus offering the potential to more fully characterize AOPs 
      and AOP networks. Finally, CRISPR-Cas9 can generate complex animal models in which 
      to conduct preclinical toxicity testing at the level of individual genotypes or 
      haplotypes. Therefore, CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful and flexible functional genomic 
      screening approach that can be harnessed to provide unprecedented mechanistic 
      insight in the field of modern toxicology.

AB  - Over the past two decades, the discovery of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and the 
      repurposing of their effector nucleases as biotechnological tools have 
      revolutionized genome editing. The corresponding work has been captured by 90,000 
      authors representing 7,600 affiliations in 126 countries, who have published more 
      than 19,000 papers spanning medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Here, we use 
      tech mining and an integrated bibliometric and networks framework to investigate the 
      CRISPR literature over three time periods. The analysis identified seminal papers, 
      leading authors, influential journals, and rising applications and topics 
      interconnected through collaborative networks. A core set of foundational topics 
      gave rise to diverging avenues of research and applications, reflecting a bona fide 
      disruptive emerging technology. This analysis illustrates how bibliometrics can 
      identify key factors, decipher rising trends, and untangle emerging applications and 
      technologies that dynamically shape a morphing field, and provides insights into the 
      trajectory of genome editing.

AB  - Investigations into cells and their contents have provided evolving insight into the 
      emergence of complex biological behaviors. Capitalizing on this knowledge, synthetic 
      biology seeks to manipulate the cellular machinery towards novel purposes, extending 
      discoveries from basic science to new applications. While these developments have 
      demonstrated the potential of building with biological parts, the complexity of 
      cells can pose numerous challenges. In this review, we will highlight the broad and 
      vital role that the synthetic biology approach has played in applying fundamental 
      biological discoveries in receptors, genetic circuits, and genome-editing systems 
      towards translation in the fields of immunotherapy, biosensors, disease models and 
      gene therapy. These examples are evidence of the strength of synthetic approaches, 
      while also illustrating considerations that must be addressed when developing 
      systems around living cells.

TI  - Combinatorial pathway engineering using type I-E CRISPR interference.
PG  - 1878-1883
LID - 10.1002/bit.26589 [doi]
AB  - Optimization of metabolic flux is a difficult and time-consuming process that often 
      involves changing the expression levels of multiple genes simultaneously. While some 
      pathways have a known rate limiting step, more complex metabolic networks can 
      require a trial-and-error approach of tuning the expression of multiple genes to 
      achieve a desired distribution of metabolic resources. Here we present an efficient 
      method for generating expression diversity on a combinatorial scale using CRISPR 
      interference. We use a modified native Escherichia coli Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system 
      and an iterative cloning strategy for construction of guide RNA arrays. This 
      approach allowed us to build a combinatorial gene expression library three orders of 
      magnitude larger than previous studies. In less than 1 month, we generated ∼12,000 
      combinatorial gene expression variants that target six different genes and screened 
      these variants for increased malonyl-CoA flux and 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) 
      production. We were able to identify a set of variants that exhibited a significant 
      increase in malonyl-CoA flux and up to a 98% increase in 3HP production. This 
      approach provides a fast and easy-to-implement strategy for engineering metabolic 
      pathway flux for development of industrially relevant strains, as well as 
      investigation of fundamental biological questions.

AB  - Transcriptional regulation by nuclease-deficient CRISPR/Cas is a popular and 
      valuable tool for routine control of gene expression. CRISPR interference in 
      bacteria can be reliably achieved with high efficiencies. Yet, options for CRISPR 
      activation (CRISPRa) remained limited in flexibility and activity because they 
      relied on σ(70) promoters. Here we report a eukaryote-like bacterial CRISPRa system 
      based on σ(54)-dependent promoters, which supports long distance, and hence 
      multi-input regulation with high dynamic ranges. Our CRISPRa device can activate 
      σ(54)-dependent promoters with biotechnology relevance in non-model bacteria. It 
      also supports orthogonal gene regulation on multiple levels. Combining our CRISPRa 
      with dxCas9 further expands flexibility in DNA targeting, and boosts dynamic ranges 
      into regimes that enable construction of cascaded CRISPRa circuits. 
      Application-wise, we construct a reusable scanning platform for readily optimizing 
      metabolic pathways without library reconstructions. This eukaryote-like CRISPRa 
      system is therefore a powerful and versatile synthetic biology tool for diverse 
      research and industrial applications.

TI  - A long non-coding RNA (Lrap) modulates brain gene expression and levels of alcohol 
      consumption in rats.
PG  - e12698

LID - e12698
AB  - LncRNAs are important regulators of quantitative and qualitative features of the 
      transcriptome. We have used QTL and other statistical analyses to identify a gene 
      coexpression module associated with alcohol consumption. The "hub gene" of this 
      module, Lrap (Long non-coding RNA for alcohol preference), was an unannotated 
      transcript resembling a lncRNA. We used partial correlation analyses to establish 
      that Lrap is a major contributor to the integrity of the coexpression module. Using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we disrupted an exon of Lrap in Wistar rats. Measures of 
      alcohol consumption in wild type, heterozygous and knockout rats showed that 
      disruption of Lrap produced increases in alcohol consumption/alcohol preference. The 
      disruption of Lrap also produced changes in expression of over 700 other 
      transcripts. Furthermore, it became apparent that Lrap may have a function in 
      alternative splicing of the affected transcripts. The GO category of "Response to 
      Ethanol" emerged as one of the top candidates in an enrichment analysis of the 
      differentially expressed transcripts. We validate the role of Lrap as a mediator of 
      alcohol consumption by rats, and also implicate Lrap as a modifier of the expression 
      and splicing of a large number of brain transcripts. A defined subset of these 
      transcripts significantly impacts alcohol consumption by rats (and possibly humans). 
      Our work shows the pleiotropic nature of non-coding elements of the genome, the 
      power of network analysis in identifying the critical elements influencing 
      phenotypes, and the fact that not all changes produced by genetic editing are 
      critical for the concomitant changes in phenotype.

TI  - Fam20C regulates protein secretion by Cab45 phosphorylation.
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201910089 [doi]
LID - e201910089
AB  - The TGN is a key compartment for the sorting and secretion of newly synthesized 
      proteins. At the TGN, soluble proteins are sorted based on the instructions carried 
      in their oligosaccharide backbones or by a Ca2+-mediated process that involves the 
      cargo-sorting protein Cab45. Here, we show that Cab45 is phosphorylated by the 
      Golgi-specific protein kinase Fam20C. Mimicking of phosphorylation translocates 
      Cab45 into TGN-derived vesicles, which goes along with an increased export of LyzC, 
      a Cab45 client. Our findings demonstrate that Fam20C plays a key role in the export 
      of Cab45 clients by fine-tuning Cab45 oligomerization and thus impacts Cab45 
      retention in the TGN.

AB  - A central aim of synthetic biology is to build organisms that can perform useful 
      activities in response to specified conditions. The digital computing paradigm which 
      has proved so successful in electrical engineering is being mapped to synthetic 
      biological systems to allow them to make such decisions. However, stochastic 
      molecular processes have graded input-output functions, thus, bioengineers must 
      select those with desirable characteristics and refine their transfer functions to 
      build logic gates with digital-like switching behaviour. Recent efforts in genome 
      mining and the development of programmable RNA-based switches, especially CRISPRi, 
      have greatly increased the number of parts available to synthetic biologists. 
      Improvements to the digital characteristics of these parts are required to enable 
      robust predictable design of deeply layered logic circuits.

TI  - dCas9 regulator to neutralize competition in CRISPRi circuits.
PG  - 1692

AB  - CRISPRi-mediated gene regulation allows simultaneous control of many genes. However, 
      highly specific sgRNA-promoter binding is, alone, insufficient to achieve 
      independent transcriptional regulation of multiple targets. Indeed, due to 
      competition for dCas9, the repression ability of one sgRNA changes significantly 
      when another sgRNA becomes expressed. To solve this problem and decouple 
      sgRNA-mediated regulatory paths, we create a dCas9 concentration regulator that 
      implements negative feedback on dCas9 level. This allows any sgRNA to maintain an 
      approximately constant dose-response curve, independent of other sgRNAs. We 
      demonstrate the regulator performance on both single-stage and layered CRISPRi-based 
      genetic circuits, zeroing competition effects of up to 15-fold changes in circuit 
      I/O response encountered without the dCas9 regulator. The dCas9 regulator decouples 
      sgRNA-mediated regulatory paths, enabling concurrent and independent regulation of 
      multiple genes. This allows predictable composition of CRISPRi-based genetic 
      modules, which is essential in the design of larger scale synthetic genetic 
      circuits.

AB  - Target-centric drug development strategies prioritize single-target potency in vitro 
      and do not account for connectivity and multi-target effects within a signal 
      transduction network. Here, we present a systems biology approach that combines 
      transcriptomic and structural analyses with live-cell imaging to predict small 
      molecule inhibitors of TNF-induced NF-κB signaling and elucidate the network 
      response. We identify two first-in-class small molecules that inhibit the NF-κB 
      signaling pathway by preventing the maturation of a rate-limiting multiprotein 
      complex necessary for IKK activation. Our findings suggest that a network-centric 
      drug discovery approach is a promising strategy to evaluate the impact of 
      pharmacologic intervention in signaling.

AB  - Genome-wide screens are a powerful technique to dissect the complex network of genes 
      regulating diverse cellular phenotypes. The recent adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 
      system for genome engineering has revolutionized functional genomic screening. Here, 
      we present protocols used to introduce Cas9 into human lymphoma cell lines, produce 
      high-titer lentivirus of a genome-wide sgRNA library, transduce and culture cells 
      during the screen, isolate genomic DNA, and prepare a custom library for 
      next-generation sequencing. These protocols were tailored for loss-of-function 
      CRISPR screens in human lymphoma cell lines but are highly amenable for other 
      experimental purposes.

TI  - In silico sgRNA tool design for CRISPR control of quorum sensing in Acinetobacter 
      species.

AB  - CRISPR genome editing utilizes Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNA (sgRNA), which 
      directs the nuclease to a specific site in the genome and makes a double-stranded 
      break (DSB). Design of sgRNA for CRISPR-Cas targeting, and to promote CRISPR 
      adaptation, uses a regulatory mechanism that ensures maximum CRISPR-Cas9 system 
      functions when a bacterial population is at highest risk of phage infection. 
      Acinetobacter baumannii is the most regularly identified gram-negative bacterium 
      infecting patients. Recent reports have demonstrated that the extent of diseases 
      caused by A. baumannii is expanding and, in a few cases, now surpasses the quantity 
      of infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Most Acinetobacter strains possess 
      biofilm-forming ability, which plays a major role in virulence and drug resistance. 
      Biofilm bacteria use quorum sensing, a cell-to-cell communication process, to 
      activate gene expression. Many genes are involved in biofilm formation and the 
      mechanism to disrupt the biofilm network is still not clearly understood. In this 
      study, we performed in silico gene editing to exploit the AbaI gene, responsible for 
      biofilm formation. The study explored different tools available for genome editing 
      to create gene knockouts, selecting the A. baumannii AbaI gene as a target.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing is a powerful tool for generating genetically 
      mutated cells and organisms. Linearisation of donor cassettes with this system has 
      been shown to facilitate both transgene donor insertion and targeted knock-in. Here, 
      we developed a donor plasmid that we name pCriMGET (plasmid of synthetic CRISPR 
      coded RNA target sequence-equipped donor plasmid-mediated gene targeting), in which 
      an off-target free synthetic CRISPR coded RNA-target sequence (syn-crRNA-TS) is 
      incorporated with a multi-cloning site, where a donor cassette can be inserted. With 
      co-expression of Cas9 and the syn-crRNA-TS guide RNA (gRNA), pCriMGET provides a 
      linearised donor cassette in vivo, thereby promoting the transgene donor insertion 
      and targeted knock-in. When co-injected with Cas9 protein and gRNA into murine 
      zygotes, pCriMGET yielded around 20% transgene insertion in embryos. This method 
      also achieved more than 25% in-frame knock-in at the mouse Tbx3 gene locus without 
      predicted insertion-deletion mutations using a transgene donor with 400-bp homology 
      arms. pCriMGET is therefore useful as a versatile CRISPR/Cas9-cleavable donor 
      plasmid for efficient integration and targeted knock-in of exogenous DNA in mice.

TI  - Multivalent Duplexed-Aptamer Networks Regulated a CRISPR-Cas12a System for 
      Circulating Tumor Cell Detection.
PG  - 12921-12929
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02228 [doi]
AB  - Although circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have great potential to act as the 
      mini-invasive liquid biopsy cancer biomarker, a rapid and sensitive CTC detection 
      method remains lacking. CRISPR-Cas12a has recently emerged as a promising tool in 
      biosensing applications with the characteristic of fast detection, easy operation, 
      and high sensitivity. Herein, we reported a CRISPR-Cas12a-based CTC detection sensor 
      that is regulated by the multivalent duplexed-aptamer networks (MDANs). MDANs were 
      synthesized on a magnetic bead surface by rolling circle amplification (RCA), which 
      contain multiple duplexed-aptamer units that allow structure switching induced by 
      cell-binding events. The presence of target cells can trigger the release of free 
      "activator DNA" from the MDANs structure to activate the downstream CRISPR-Cas12a 
      for signal amplification. Furthermore, the 3D DNA network formed by RCA products 
      also provided significantly higher sensitivity than the monovalent aptamer. As a 
      proof-of-concept study, we chose the most widely used sgc8 aptamer that specifically 
      recognizes CCRF-CEM cells to validate the proposed approach. The MDANs-Cas12a system 
      could afford a simple and fast CTC detection workflow with a detection limit of 26 
      cells mL(-1). We also demonstrated that the MDANs-Cas12a could directly detect the 
      CTCs in human blood samples, indicating a great potential of the MDANs-Cas12a in 
      clinical CTC-based liquid biopsy.

TI  - Synthetic bionanotechnology: synthetic biology finds a toehold in nanotechnology.
PG  - 507-516
LID - 10.1042/ETLS20190100 [doi]
AB  - Enabled by its central role in the molecular networks that govern cell function, RNA 
      has been widely used for constructing components used in biological circuits for 
      synthetic biology. Nucleic acid nanotechnology, which exploits predictable nucleic 
      acid interactions to implement programmable molecular systems, has seen remarkable 
      advances in in vitro nanoscale self-assembly and molecular computation, enabling the 
      production of complex nanostructures and DNA-based neural networks. Living cells 
      genetically engineered to execute nucleic acid nanotechnology programs thus have 
      outstanding potential to significantly extend the current limits of synthetic 
      biology. This perspective discusses the recent developments and future challenges in 
      the field of synthetic bionanotechnology. Thus far, researchers in this emerging 
      area have implemented dozens of programmable RNA nanodevices that provide precise 
      control over gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels and 
      through CRISPR/Cas effectors. Moreover, they have employed synthetic self-assembling 
      RNA networks in engineered bacteria to carry out computations featuring up to a 
      dozen inputs and to substantially enhance the rate of chemical synthesis. Continued 
      advancement of the field will benefit from improved in vivo strategies for 
      streamlining nucleic acid network synthesis and new approaches for enhancing network 
      function. As the field matures and the complexity gap between in vitro and in vivo 
      systems narrows, synthetic bionanotechnology promises to have diverse potential 
      applications ranging from intracellular circuits that detect and treat disease to 
      synthetic enzymatic pathways that efficiently produce novel drug molecules.

AB  - Cyanobacteria hold promise as a cell factory for producing biofuels and bio-derived 
      chemicals, but genome engineering of cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus elongatus 
      PCC 7942 poses challenges because of their oligoploidy nature and long-term 
      instability of the introduced gene. CRISPR-Cas9 is a newly developed RNA-guided 
      genome editing system, yet its application for cyanobacteria engineering has yet to 
      be reported. Here we demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 system can effectively trigger 
      programmable double strand break (DSB) at the chromosome of PCC 7942 and provoke 
      cell death. With the co-transformation of template plasmid harboring the gene 
      cassette and flanking homology arms, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DSB enabled precise gene 
      integration, ameliorated the homologous recombination efficiency and allowed the use 
      of lower amount of template DNA and shorter homology arms. The CRISPR-Cas9-induced 
      cell death imposed selective pressure and enhanced the chance of concomitant 
      integration of gene cassettes into all chromosomes of PCC 7942, hence accelerating 
      the process of obtaining homogeneous and stable recombinant strains. We further 
      explored the feasibility of engineering cyanobacteria by CRISPR-Cas9-assisted 
      simultaneous glgc knock-out and gltA/ppc knock-in, which improved the succinate 
      titer to 435.0±35.0μg/L, an ≈11-fold increase when compared with that of the 
      wild-type cells. These data altogether justify the use of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome 
      engineering and manipulation of metabolic pathways in cyanobacteria.

AB  - With rapid progress in DNA synthesis and sequencing, strain engineering starts to be 
      the rate-limiting step in synthetic biology. Here, we report a gRNA-tRNA array for 
      CRISPR-Cas9 (GTR-CRISPR) for multiplexed engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
      Using reported gRNAs shown to be effective, this system enables simultaneous 
      disruption of 8 genes with 87% efficiency. We further report an accelerated 
      Lightning GTR-CRISPR that avoids the cloning step in Escherichia coli by directly 
      transforming the Golden Gate reaction mix to yeast. This approach enables disruption 
      of 6 genes in 3 days with 60% efficiency using reported gRNAs and 23% using 
      un-optimized gRNAs. Moreover, we applied the Lightning GTR-CRISPR to simplify yeast 
      lipid networks, resulting in a 30-fold increase in free fatty acid production in 10 
      days using just two-round deletions of eight previously identified genes. The 
      GTR-CRISPR should be an invaluable addition to the toolbox of synthetic biology and 
      automation.

AB  - Iron is a crucial component of heme- and iron-sulfur clusters, involved in vital 
      cellular functions such as oxygen transport, DNA synthesis, and respiration. Both 
      excess and insufficient levels of iron and heme-precursors cause human disease, such 
      as iron-deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, and porphyrias. Hence, their levels must 
      be tightly regulated, requiring a complex network of transporters and feedback 
      mechanisms. The use of zebrafish to study these pathways and the underlying genetics 
      offers many advantages, among others their optical transparency, ex-vivo development 
      and high genetic and physiological conservations. This chapter first reviews 
      well-established methods, such as large-scale mutagenesis screens that have led to 
      the initial identification of a series of iron and heme transporters and the 
      generation of a variety of mutant lines. Other widely used techniques are based on 
      injection of RNA, including complementary morpholino knockdown and gene 
      overexpression. In addition, we highlight several recently developed approaches, 
      most notably endonuclease-based gene knockouts such as TALENs or the CRISPR/Cas9 
      system that have been used to study how loss of function can induce human disease 
      phenocopies in zebrafish. Rescue by chemical complementation with iron-based 
      compounds or small molecules can subsequently be used to confirm causality of the 
      genetic defect for the observed phenotype. All together, zebrafish have proven to be 
      - and will continue to serve as an ideal model to advance our understanding of the 
      pathogenesis of human iron and heme-related diseases and to develop novel therapies 
      to treat these conditions.

TI  - Alternate binding modes of anti-CRISPR viral suppressors AcrF1/2 to Csy surveillance 
      complex revealed by cryo-EM structures.
PG  - 853-864
LID - 10.1038/cr.2017.79 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages encode anti-CRISPR suppressors to counteract the CRISPR/Cas immunity 
      of their bacterial hosts, thus facilitating their survival and replication. Previous 
      studies have shown that two phage-encoded anti-CRISPR proteins, AcrF1 and AcrF2, 
      suppress the type I-F CRISPR/Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by preventing 
      target DNA recognition by the Csy surveillance complex, but the precise underlying 
      mechanism was unknown. Here we present the structure of AcrF1/2 bound to the Csy 
      complex determined by cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction. By structural 
      analysis, we found that AcrF1 inhibits target DNA recognition of the Csy complex by 
      interfering with base pairing between the DNA target strand and crRNA spacer. In 
      addition, multiple copies of AcrF1 bind to the Csy complex with different modes when 
      working individually or cooperating with AcrF2, which might exclude target DNA 
      binding through different mechanisms. Together with previous reports, we provide a 
      comprehensive working scenario for the two anti-CRISPR suppressors, AcrF1 and AcrF2, 
      which silence CRISPR/Cas immunity by targeting the Csy surveillance complex.

AB  - Enzymes that produce second messengers are highly regulated. Revealing the 
      mechanisms underlying such regulation is critical to understanding both how cells 
      achieve specific signaling outcomes and return to homeostasis following a particular 
      stimulus. Pooled genome-wide CRISPR screens are powerful unbiased approaches to 
      elucidate regulatory networks, their principal limitation being the choice of 
      phenotype selection. Here, we merge advances in bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling 
      and CRISPR screening technologies to discover regulators of phospholipase D (PLD) 
      signaling, which generates the potent lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid. Our 
      results reveal glycogen synthase kinase 3 as a positive regulator of protein kinase 
      C and PLD signaling. More generally, this work demonstrates how bioorthogonal, 
      activity-based fluorescent tagging can expand the power of CRISPR screening to 
      uncover mechanisms regulating specific enzyme-driven signaling pathways in mammalian 
      cells.

AB  - The recent expansion of molecular tool kits has propelled synthetic biology toward 
      the design of increasingly sophisticated mammalian systems. Specifically, advances 
      in genome editing, protein engineering, and circuitry design have enabled the 
      programming of cells for diverse applications, including regenerative medicine and 
      cancer immunotherapy. The ease with which molecular and cellular interactions can be 
      harnessed promises to yield novel approaches to elucidate genetic interactions, 
      program cellular functions, and design therapeutic interventions. Here, we review 
      recent advancements in the development of enabling technologies and the practical 
      applications of mammalian synthetic biology.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a vast repertoire of RNAs playing a wide 
      variety of crucial roles in tissue physiology in a cell-specific manner. Despite 
      being engaged in myriads of regulatory mechanisms, many lncRNAs have still remained 
      to be assigned any functions. A constellation of experimental techniques including 
      single-molecule RNA in situ hybridization (sm-RNA FISH), cross-linking and 
      immunoprecipitation (CLIP), RNA interference (RNAi), Clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and so forth has been employed to shed light on 
      lncRNA cellular localization, structure, interaction networks and functions. Here, 
      we review these and other experimental approaches in common use for identification 
      and characterization of lncRNAs, particularly those involved in different types of 
      cancer, with focus on merits and demerits of each technique.

TI  - A CRISPR-based approach for targeted DNA demethylation.
PG  - 16009
LID - 10.1038/celldisc.2016.9 [doi]
AB  - In mammalian cells, DNA methylation critically regulates gene expression and thus 
      has pivotal roles in myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Here we 
      report a novel method for targeted DNA demethylation using the widely used clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system. Initially, 
      modified single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) (sgRNA2.0) were constructed by inserting two 
      copies of bacteriophage MS2 RNA elements into the conventional sgRNAs, which would 
      facilitate the tethering of the Tet1 catalytic domain (Tet-CD), in fusion with dCas9 
      or MS2 coat proteins, to the targeted gene loci. Subsequently, such system was shown 
      to significantly upregulate transcription of the target genes, including RANKL, 
      MAGEB2 or MMP2, which was in close correlation to DNA demethylation of their 
      neighboring CpGs in the promoters. In addition, the dCas9/sgRNA2.0-directed 
      demethylation system appeared to afford efficient demethylation of the target genes 
      with tenuous off-target effects. Applications of this system would not only help us 
      understand mechanistically how DNA methylation might regulate gene expression in 
      specific contexts, but also enable control of gene expression and functionality with 
      potential clinical benefits.

TI  - CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain.
PG  - 447-454
LID - 10.1038/s41593-018-0077-5 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 has been demonstrated to delete genes in postmitotic neurons. Compared 
      to the establishment of proliferative cell lines or animal strains, it is more 
      challenging to acquire a highly homogeneous consequence of gene editing in a stable 
      neural network. Here we show that dCas9-based CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) can 
      efficiently silence genes in neurons. Using a pseudotarget fishing strategy, we 
      demonstrate that CRISPRi shows superior targeting specificity without detectable 
      off-target activity. Furthermore, CRISPRi can achieve multiplex inactivation of 
      genes fundamental for neurotransmitter release with high efficiency. By developing 
      conditional CRISPRi tools targeting synaptotagmin I (Syt1), we modified the 
      excitatory to inhibitory balance in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus and 
      found that the dentate gyrus has distinct regulatory roles in learning and affective 
      processes in mice. We therefore recommend CRISPRi as a useful tool for more rapid 
      investigation of gene function in the mammalian brain.

AB  - MitoNEET (mNEET) is a dimeric mitochondrial outer membrane protein implicated in 
      many facets of human pathophysiology, notably diabetes and cancer, but its molecular 
      function remains poorly characterized. In this study, we generated and analyzed 
      mNEET KO cells and found that in these cells the mitochondrial network was 
      disturbed. Analysis of 3D-EM reconstructions and of thin sections revealed that 
      genetic inactivation of mNEET did not affect the size of mitochondria but that the 
      frequency of intermitochondrial junctions was reduced. Loss of mNEET decreased 
      cellular respiration, because of a reduction in the total cellular mitochondrial 
      volume, suggesting that intermitochondrial contacts stabilize individual 
      mitochondria. Reexpression of mNEET in mNEET KO cells restored the WT morphology of 
      the mitochondrial network, and reexpression of a mutant mNEET resistant to oxidative 
      stress increased in addition the resistance of the mitochondrial network to 
      H(2)O(2)-induced fragmentation. Finally, overexpression of mNEET increased strongly 
      intermitochondrial contacts and resulted in the clustering of mitochondria. Our 
      results suggest that mNEET plays a specific role in the formation of 
      intermitochondrial junctions and thus participates in the adaptation of cells to 
      physiological changes and to the control of mitochondrial homeostasis.

PG  - 644622
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2021.644622 [doi]
LID - 644622
AB  - Bacteriophage-encoded single strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) are recombinases 
      which can substitute the classical, bacterial RecA and manage the DNA metabolism at 
      different steps of phage propagation. SSAPs have been shown to efficiently promote 
      recombination between short and rather divergent DNA sequences and were exploited 
      for in vivo genetic engineering mainly in Gram-negative bacteria. In opposition to 
      the conserved and almost universal bacterial RecA protein, SSAPs display great 
      sequence diversity. The importance for SSAPs in phage biology and phage-bacteria 
      evolution is underlined by their role as key players in events of horizontal gene 
      transfer (HGT). All of the above provoke a constant interest for the identification 
      and study of new phage recombinase proteins in vivo, in vitro as well as in silico. 
      Despite this, a huge body of putative ssap genes escapes conventional 
      classification, as they are not properly annotated. In this work, we performed a 
      wide-scale identification, classification and analysis of SSAPs encoded by the 
      Firmicutes bacteria and their phages. By using sequence similarity network and gene 
      context analyses, we created a new high quality dataset of phage-related SSAPs, 
      substantially increasing the number of annotated SSAPs. We classified the identified 
      SSAPs into seven distinct families, namely RecA, Gp2.5, RecT/Redβ, Erf, Rad52/22, 
      Sak3, and Sak4, organized into three superfamilies. Analysis of the relationships 
      between the revealed protein clusters led us to recognize Sak3-like proteins as a 
      new distinct SSAP family. Our analysis showed an irregular phylogenetic distribution 
      of ssap genes among different bacterial phyla and specific phages, which can be 
      explained by the high rates of ssap HGT. We propose that the evolution of phage 
      recombinases could be tightly linked to the dissemination of bacterial 
      phage-resistance mechanisms (e.g., abortive infection and CRISPR/Cas systems) 
      targeting ssap genes and be a part of the constant phage-bacteria arms race.

AB  - To construct CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for the editing of SmPAL1 in the phenylpropane 
      metabolic pathway of Salvia miltiorrhiza, CIRSPR/Cas9 target sites of SmPAL1 were 
      designed by online software. Its target efficiencies were detected in vitro by 
      enzyme digestion and sequences with highly efficiency were constructed into 
      CRISPR/Cas9 vectors. Three possible CRISPR target sequences (SmPAL1-g1, SmPAL1-g2, 
      SmPAL1-g3) were designed and the enzyme digestion efficiencies were 53.3%, 76.6% and 
      10.0%. SmPAL1-g1 and SmPAL1-g2 were constructed into vector VK005-03 named as 
      VK005-03-g1 and VK005-03-g2. The results of sequencing showed that the two 
      CRISPR/Cas target sequences were all constructed into VK005-03. Here we first laid 
      the foundation for the study of SmPAL1 and provided an effective strategy for the 
      screening of sgRNA.

      Parkinson's disease (PD), the use of iPSC-based models is beginning to provide

      update on recently reported genetic risk factors associated with PD. We discuss how 
      iPSC technology, combined with targeted edition of the coding or noncoding genome, 
      can be used to address clinical observations such as incomplete penetrance, and 
      variability in phenoconversion or age-at-onset in familial PD. Finally, we also 
      discuss the relevance of advanced iPSC/CRISPR/Cas9 disease models to ascertain 
      causality in genotype-to-phenotype correlation studies of sporadic PD.

AB  - Protein ubiquitylation is an important post-translational modification, regulating 
      aspects of virtually every biochemical pathway in eukaryotic cells. Hundreds of 
      enzymes participate in the conjugation and deconjugation of ubiquitin, as well as 
      the recognition, signaling functions, and degradation of ubiquitylated proteins. 
      Regulation of ubiquitylation is most commonly at the level of recognition of 
      substrates by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Characterization of the network of E3-substrate 
      relationships is a major goal and challenge in the field, as this expected to yield 
      fundamental biological insights and opportunities for drug development. There has 
      been remarkable success in identifying substrates for some E3 ligases, in many 
      instances using the standard protein-protein interaction techniques (e.g., 
      two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitations paired with mass spectrometry). 
      However, some E3s have remained refractory to characterization, while others have 
      simply not yet been studied due to the sheer number and diversity of E3s. This 
      review will discuss the range of tools and techniques that can be used for substrate 
      profiling of E3 ligases.

AB  - Amino acids find various applications in biotechnology in view of their importance 
      in the food, feed, pharmaceutical, and personal care industries as nutrients, 
      additives, and drugs, respectively. For the large-scale production of amino acids, 
      microbial cell factories are widely used and the development of amino acid-producing 
      strains has mainly focused on prokaryotes Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia 
      coli. However, the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is becoming an even more 
      appealing microbial host for production of amino acids and derivatives because of 
      its superior molecular and physiological features, such as amenable to genetic 
      engineering and high tolerance to harsh conditions. To transform S. cerevisiae into 
      an industrial amino acid production platform, the highly coordinated and multiple 
      layers regulation in its amino acid metabolism should be relieved and reconstituted 
      to optimize the metabolic flux toward synthesis of target products. This chapter 
      describes principles, strategies, and applications of modular pathway rewiring in 
      yeast using the engineering of l-ornithine metabolism as a paradigm. Additionally, 
      detailed protocols for in vitro module construction and CRISPR/Cas-mediated pathway 
      assembly are provided.

      Plants for Diversified and Sustainable Food Security.

LID - 8093
AB  - Indigenous communities across the globe, especially in rural areas, consume locally 
      available plants known as Traditional Food Plants (TFPs) for their nutritional and 
      health-related needs. Recent research shows that many TFPs are highly nutritious as 
      they contain health beneficial metabolites, vitamins, mineral elements and other 
      nutrients. Excessive reliance on the mainstream staple crops has its own 
      disadvantages. Traditional food plants are nowadays considered important crops of 
      the future and can act as supplementary foods for the burgeoning global population. 
      They can also act as emergency foods in situations such as COVID-19 and in times of 
      other pandemics. The current situation necessitates locally available alternative 
      nutritious TFPs for sustainable food production. To increase the cultivation or 
      improve the traits in TFPs, it is essential to understand the molecular basis of the 
      genes that regulate some important traits such as nutritional components and 
      resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses. The integrated use of modern omics and 
      gene editing technologies provide great opportunities to better understand the 
      genetic and molecular basis of superior nutrient content, climate-resilient traits 
      and adaptation to local agroclimatic zones. Recently, realizing the importance and 
      benefits of TFPs, scientists have shown interest in the prospection and sequencing 
      of TFPs for their improvements, cultivation and mainstreaming. Integrated omics such 
      as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and ionomics are successfully 
      used in plants and have provided a comprehensive understanding of 
      gene-protein-metabolite networks. Combined use of omics and editing tools has led to 
      successful editing of beneficial traits in several TFPs. This suggests that there is 
      ample scope for improvement of TFPs for sustainable food production. In this 
      article, we highlight the importance, scope and progress towards improvement of TFPs 
      for valuable traits by integrated use of omics and gene editing techniques.

AB  - Genome-scale engineering is an indispensable tool to understand genome functions due 
      to our limited knowledge of cellular networks. Unfortunately, most existing methods 
      for genome-wide genotype-phenotype mapping are limited to a single mode of genomic 
      alteration, i.e. overexpression, repression, or deletion. Here we report a 
      multi-functional genome-wide CRISPR (MAGIC) system to precisely control the 
      expression level of defined genes to desired levels throughout the whole genome. By 
      combining the tri-functional CRISPR system and array-synthesized oligo pools, MAGIC 
      is used to create, to the best of our knowledge, one of the most comprehensive and 
      diversified genomic libraries in yeast ever reported. The power of MAGIC is 
      demonstrated by the identification of previously uncharacterized genetic 
      determinants of complex phenotypes, particularly those having synergistic 
      interactions when perturbed to different expression levels. MAGIC represents a 
      powerful synthetic biology tool to investigate fundamental biological questions as 
      well as engineer complex phenotypes for biotechnological applications.

      establishing optimal activity of heterologous pathways and further metabolic 
      engineering of the host strain to maximize product yield and titer. Adequate stress 
      tolerance of the host strain has turned out to be another major challenge for 
      obtaining economically viable performance in industrial production. Although general 
      robustness is a universal requirement for industrial microorganisms, production of 
      novel compounds using artificial metabolic pathways presents additional challenges. 
      Many of the bio-based compounds desirable for production by cell factories are 
      highly toxic to the host cells in the titers required for economic viability. 
      Artificial metabolic pathways also turn out to be much more sensitive to stress 
      factors than endogenous pathways, likely because regulation of the latter has been 
      optimized in evolution in myriads of environmental conditions. We discuss different 
      environmental and metabolic stress factors with high relevance for industrial 
      utilization of yeast cell factories and the experimental approaches used to engineer 
      higher stress tolerance. Improving stress tolerance in a predictable manner in yeast 
      cell factories should facilitate their widespread utilization in the bio-based 
      economy and extend the range of products successfully produced in large scale in a 
      sustainable and economically profitable way.

TI  - CROTON: an automated and variant-aware deep learning framework for predicting 
      CRISPR/Cas9 editing outcomes.
PG  - i342-i348
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btab268 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: CRISPR/Cas9 is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that has been 
      widely utilized in biology, biotechnology and medicine. CRISPR/Cas9 editing outcomes 
      depend on local DNA sequences at the target site and are thus predictable. However, 
      existing prediction methods are dependent on both feature and model engineering, 
      which restricts their performance to existing knowledge about CRISPR/Cas9 editing. 
      RESULTS: Herein, deep multi-task convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and neural 
      architecture search (NAS) were used to automate both feature and model engineering 
      and create an end-to-end deep-learning framework, CROTON (CRISPR Outcomes Through 
      cONvolutional neural networks). The CROTON model architecture was tuned 
      automatically with NAS on a synthetic large-scale construct-based dataset and then 
      tested on an independent primary T cell genomic editing dataset. CROTON outperformed 
      existing expert-designed models and non-NAS CNNs in predicting 1 base pair insertion 
      and deletion probability as well as deletion and frameshift frequency. 
      Interpretation of CROTON revealed local sequence determinants for diverse editing 
      outcomes. Finally, CROTON was utilized to assess how single nucleotide variants 
      (SNVs) affect the genome editing outcomes of four clinically relevant target genes: 
      the viral receptors ACE2 and CCR5 and the immune checkpoint inhibitors CTLA4 and 
      PDCD1. Large SNV-induced differences in CROTON predictions in these target genes 
      suggest that SNVs should be taken into consideration when designing widely 
      applicable gRNAs. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/vli31/CROTON.

AB  - Microorganisms play a crucial role in the sustainability of the various ecosystems. 
      The characterization of various interactions between microorganisms and other biotic 
      factors is a necessary footstep to understand the association and functions of 
      microbial communities. Among the different microbial interactions in an ecosystem, 
      plant-microbe interaction plays an important role to balance the ecosystem. The 
      present review explores plant-microbe interactions using gene editing and system 
      biology tools toward the comprehension in improvement of plant traits. Further, 
      system biology tools like FBA (flux balance analysis), OptKnock, and 
      constraint-based modeling helps in understanding such interactions as a whole. In 
      addition, various gene editing tools have been summarized and a strategy has been 
      hypothesized for the development of disease free plants. Furthermore, we have tried 
      to summarize the predictions through data retrieved from various types of sources 
      such as high throughput sequencing data (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism 
      detection, RNA-seq, proteomics) and metabolic models have been reconstructed from 
      such sequences for species communities. It is well known fact that systems biology 
      approaches and modeling of biological networks will enable us to learn the insight 
      of such network and will also help further in understanding these interactions.

AB  - Media and feed optimization have fueled many-fold improvements in mammalian 
      biopharmaceutical production, but genome editing offers an emerging avenue for 
      further enhancing cell metabolism and bioproduction. However, the complexity of 
      metabolism, involving thousands of genes, makes it unclear which engineering 
      strategies will result in desired traits. Here we present a comprehensive pooled 
      CRISPR screen for CHO cell metabolism, including ~16,000 gRNAs against ~2500 
      metabolic enzymes and regulators. Using this screen, we identified a glutamine 
      response network in CHO cells. Glutamine is particularly important since it is often 
      over-fed to drive increased TCA cycle flux, but toxic ammonia may accumulate. With 
      the screen we found one orphan glutamine-responsive gene with no clear connection to 
      our network. Knockout of this novel and poorly characterized lipase, Abhd11, 
      substantially increased growth in glutamine-free media by altering the regulation of 
      the TCA cycle. Thus, the screen provides an invaluable targeted platform to 
      comprehensively study genes involved in any metabolic trait, and elucidate novel 
      regulators of metabolism.

AB  - Our limited ability to predict genotype-phenotype relationships has called for 
      strategies that allow testing of thousands of hypotheses in parallel. Deep scanning 
      mutagenesis has been successfully implemented to map genotype-phenotype 
      relationships at a single-protein scale, allowing scientists to elucidate properties 
      that are difficult to predict. However, most phenotypes are dictated by several 
      proteins that are interconnected through complex and robust regulatory and metabolic 
      networks. These sophisticated networks hinder our understanding of the phenotype of 
      interest and limit our capabilities to rewire cellular functions. Here, we leveraged 
      CRISPR-EnAbled Trackable genome Engineering to attempt a parallel and 
      high-resolution interrogation of complex networks, deep scanning multiple proteins 
      associated with lysine metabolism in Escherichia coli We designed over 16,000 
      mutations to perturb this pathway and mapped their contribution toward resistance to 
      an amino acid analog. By doing so, we identified different routes that can alter 
      pathway function and flux, uncovering mechanisms that would be difficult to 
      rationally design. This approach sets a framework for forward investigation of 
      complex multigenic phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CRISPR-Cpf1 has recently been reported as another RNA-guided 
      endonuclease of class 2 CRISPR-Cas system, which expands the molecular biology 
      toolkit for genome editing. However, most of the online tools and applications to 
      date have been developed primarily for the Cas9. There are a limited number of tools 
      available for the Cpf1. RESULTS: We present DeepCpf1, a deep convolution neural 
      networks (CNN) approach to predict Cpf1 guide RNAs on-target activity and off-target 
      effects using their matched and mismatched DNA sequences. Trained on published data 
      sets, DeepCpf1 is superior to other machine learning algorithms and reliably 
      predicts the most efficient and less off-target effects guide RNAs for a given gene. 
      Combined with a permutation importance analysis, the key features of guide RNA 
      sequences are identified, which determine the activity and specificity of genome 
      editing. CONCLUSIONS: DeepCpf1 can significantly improve the accuracy of Cpf1-based 
      genome editing and facilitates the generation of optimized guide RNAs libraries.

AB  - Tumor-specific genomic alterations allow systematic identification of genetic 
      interactions that promote tumorigenesis and tumor vulnerabilities, offering novel 
      strategies for development of targeted therapies for individual patients. We develop 
      an Individualized Network-based Co-Mutation (INCM) methodology by inspecting over 
      2.5 million nonsynonymous somatic mutations derived from 6,789 tumor exomes across 
      14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our INCM analysis reveals a higher 
      genetic interaction burden on the significantly mutated genes, experimentally 
      validated cancer genes, chromosome regulatory factors, and DNA damage repair genes, 
      as compared to human pan-cancer essential genes identified by CRISPR-Cas9 screenings 
      on 324 cancer cell lines. We find that genes involved in the cancer type-specific 
      genetic subnetworks identified by INCM are significantly enriched in established 
      cancer pathways, and the INCM-inferred putative genetic interactions are correlated 
      with patient survival. By analyzing drug pharmacogenomics profiles from the Genomics 
      of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we show that the network-predicted putative 
      genetic interactions (e.g., BRCA2-TP53) are significantly correlated with 
      sensitivity/resistance of multiple therapeutic agents. We experimentally validated 
      that afatinib has the strongest cytotoxic activity on BT474 (IC50 = 55.5 nM, BRCA2 
      and TP53 co-mutant) compared to MCF7 (IC50 = 7.7 μM, both BRCA2 and TP53 wild type) 
      and MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 7.9 μM, BRCA2 wild type but TP53 mutant). Finally, 
      drug-target network analysis reveals several potential druggable genetic 
      interactions by targeting tumor vulnerabilities. This study offers a powerful 
      network-based methodology for identification of candidate therapeutic pathways that 
      target tumor vulnerabilities and prioritization of potential pharmacogenomics 
      biomarkers for development of personalized cancer medicine.

TI  - A RecET-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in Corynebacterium glutamicum.
PG  - 63

LID - 63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive modification of genome is an efficient manner to regulate the 
      metabolic network for producing target metabolites or non-native products using 
      Corynebacterium glutamicum as a cell factory. Genome editing approaches by means of 
      homologous recombination and counter-selection markers are laborious and time 
      consuming due to multiple round manipulations and low editing efficiencies. The 
      current two-plasmid-based CRISPR-Cas9 editing methods generate false positives due 
      to the potential instability of Cas9 on the plasmid, and require a high 
      transformation efficiency for co-occurrence of two plasmids transformation. RESULTS: 
      Here, we developed a RecET-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method using a 
      chromosome-borne Cas9-RecET and a single plasmid harboring sgRNA and repair 
      templates. The inducible expression of chromosomal RecET promoted the frequencies of 
      homologous recombination, and increased the efficiency for gene deletion. Due to the 
      high transformation efficiency of a single plasmid, this method enabled 10- and 
      20-kb region deletion, 2.5-, 5.7- and 7.5-kb expression cassette insertion and 
      precise site-specific mutation, suggesting a versatility of this method. Deletion of 
      argR and farR regulators as well as site-directed mutation of argB and pgi genes 
      generated the mutant capable of accumulating L-arginine, indicating the stability of 
      chromosome-borne Cas9 for iterative genome editing. Using this method, the 
      model-predicted target genes were modified to redirect metabolic flux towards 
      1,2-propanediol biosynthetic pathway. The final engineered strain produced 
      6.75 ± 0.46 g/L of 1,2-propanediol that is the highest titer reported in C. 
      glutamicum. Furthermore, this method is available for Corynebacterium pekinense 
      1.563, suggesting its universal applicability in other Corynebacterium species. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The RecET-assisted CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method will facilitate 
      engineering of metabolic networks for the synthesis of interested bio-based products 
      from renewable biomass using Corynebacterium species as cell factories.

AB  - Many genomic techniques have been developed to study gene essentiality genome-wide, 
      such as CRISPR and shRNA screens. Our analyses of public CRISPR screens suggest 
      protein interaction networks, when integrated with gene expression or histone marks, 
      are highly predictive of gene essentiality. Meanwhile, the quality of CRISPR and 
      shRNA screen results can be significantly enhanced through network neighbor 
      information. We also found network neighbor information to be very informative on 
      prioritizing ChIP-seq target genes and survival indicator genes from tumor 
      profiling. Thus, our study provides a general method for gene essentiality analysis 
      in functional genomic experiments ( http://nest.dfci.harvard.edu ).

AB  - The control of gene expression by transcription factor binding sites frequently 
      determines phenotype. However, it is difficult to determine the function of single 
      transcription factor binding sites within larger transcription networks. Here, we 
      use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to disrupt binding to specific sites, a method we term 
      CRISPRd. Since CRISPR guide RNAs are longer than transcription factor binding sites, 
      flanking sequence can be used to target specific sites. Targeting dCas9 to an Oct4 
      site in the Nanog promoter displaced Oct4 from this site, reduced Nanog expression, 
      and slowed division. In contrast, disrupting the Oct4 binding site adjacent to Pax6 
      upregulated Pax6 transcription and disrupting Nanog binding its own promoter 
      upregulated its transcription. Thus, we can easily distinguish between activating 
      and repressing binding sites and examine autoregulation. Finally, multiple guide RNA 
      expression allows simultaneous inhibition of multiple binding sites, and 
      conditionally destabilized dCas9 allows rapid reversibility.

TI  - Recent developments of tools for genome and metabolome studies in basidiomycete 
      fungi and their application to natural product research.
LID - 10.1242/bio.056010 [doi]
LID - bio056010
AB  - Basidiomycota are a large and diverse phylum of fungi. They can make bioactive 
      metabolites that are used or have inspired the synthesis of antibiotics and 
      agrochemicals. Terpenoids are the most abundant class of natural products 
      encountered in this taxon. Other natural product classes have been described, 
      including polyketides, peptides, and indole alkaloids. The discovery and study of 
      natural products made by basidiomycete fungi has so far been hampered by several 
      factors, which include their slow growth and complex genome architecture. Recent 
      developments of tools for genome and metabolome studies are allowing researchers to 
      more easily tackle the secondary metabolome of basidiomycete fungi. Inexpensive 
      long-read whole-genome sequencing enables the assembly of high-quality genomes, 
      improving the scaffold upon which natural product gene clusters can be predicted. 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based engineering of basidiomycete fungi has been described and will 
      have an important role in linking natural products to their genetic determinants. 
      Platforms for the heterologous expression of basidiomycete genes and gene clusters 
      have been developed, enabling natural product biosynthesis studies. Molecular 
      network analyses and publicly available natural product databases facilitate data 
      dereplication and natural product characterisation. These technological advances 
      combined are prompting a revived interest in natural product discovery from 
      basidiomycete fungi.This article has an associated Future Leader to Watch interview 
      with the first author of the paper.

AB  - The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 
      (CRISPR-associated) system is a powerful genome editing tool that has been used in 
      many species. In this study, we focused on the phenolic acid metabolic pathway in 
      the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, using the CRISPR/Cas9 
      system to edit the rosmarinic acid synthase gene (SmRAS) in the water-soluble 
      phenolic acid biosynthetic pathway. The single guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed to 
      precisely edit the most important SmRAS gene, which was selected from 11 family 
      members through a bioinformatics analysis. The sequencing results showed that the 
      genomes of 50% of the transgenic regenerated hairy roots had been successfully 
      edited. Five biallelic mutants, two heterozygous mutants and one homozygous mutant 
      were obtained from 16 independent transgenic hairy root lines when the sgRNA was 
      driven by the Arabidopsis U6 promoter, while no mutants were obtained from 13 
      independent transgenic hairy root lines when the sgRNA was driven by the rice U3 
      promoter. Subsequently, expression and metabolomics analysis showed that the 
      contents of phenolic acids, including rosmarinic acid (RA) and lithospermic acid B, 
      and the RAS expression level were decreased in the successfully edited hairy root 
      lines, particularly in the homozygous mutants. In addition, the level of the RA 
      precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid clearly increased. These results indicated 
      that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be utilized to identify important genes in a gene 
      family with the assistance of bioinformatics analysis and that this new technology 
      is an efficient and specific tool for genome editing in S. miltiorrhiza. This new 
      system presents a promising potential method to regulate plant metabolic networks 
      and improve the quality of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.

AB  - Mammalian pregnancy depends on the ability of the uterus to support embryo 
      implantation. Previous studies reveal the Sox17 gene as a downstream target of the 
      Pgr-Gata2-dependent transcription network that directs genomic actions in the 
      uterine endometrium receptive for embryo implantation. Here, we report that ablating 
      Sox17 in the uterine epithelium impairs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Indian 
      hedgehog homolog (IHH) signaling, leading to failure of embryo implantation. In vivo 
      deletion of the SOX17-binding region 19 kb upstream of the Ihh locus by CRISPR-Cas 
      technology reduces Ihh expression specifically in the uterus and alters proper 
      endometrial epithelial-stromal interactions, thereby impairing pregnancy. This 
      SOX17-binding interval is also bound by GATA2, FOXA2, and PGR. This cluster of 
      transcription factor binding is common in 737 uterine genes and may represent a key 
      regulatory element essential for uterine epithelial gene expression.

AB  - The homeodomain-containing transcription factors dlx1a, dlx2a, dlx5a and dlx6a are 
      expressed in the zebrafish brain in overlapping patterns and are important in 
      vertebrate development. Previous work in mice have suggested the overlapping 
      expression pattern is in part due to cross-regulatory interactions among the 
      aforementioned dlx genes. However, the extent of these interactions and whether they 
      are conserved among vertebrates remains to be determined. Through whole-mount in 
      situ hybridization in zebrafish dlx mutants produced by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, 
      cross-regulatory interactions between dlx1a, dlx2a, dlx5a and dlx6a were examined 
      from 24 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf). Notably, and different from previous work 
      done in mouse, zebrafish dlx2a(-/-) mutants continue to express dlx5a until 72hpf, 
      whereas deletion of both enhancers within the dlx5a/dlx6a locus resulted in delayed 
      dlx5a/dlx6a expression and relative increased dlx2a expression. These results 
      suggest alternative regulatory elements and pathways exist to mediate dlx expression 
      in zebrafish and may highlight evolutionary differences in gene interactions between 
      vertebrates.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of non-coding transcripts, have recently 
      been emerging with heterogeneous molecular actions, adding a new layer of complexity 
      to gene-regulation networks in tumorigenesis. LncRNAs are considered important 
      factors in several ovarian cancer histotypes, although few have been identified and 
      characterized. Owing to their complexity and the lack of adapted molecular 
      technology, the roles of most lncRNAs remain mysterious. Some lncRNAs have been 
      reported to play functional roles in ovarian cancer and can be used as classifiers 
      for personalized medicine. The intrinsic features of lncRNAs govern their various 
      molecular mechanisms and provide a wide range of platforms to design different 
      therapeutic strategies for treating cancer at a particular stage. Although we are 
      only beginning to understand the functions of lncRNAs and their interactions with 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins, the expanding literature indicates that 
      lncRNA-miRNA interactions could be useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets for 
      ovarian cancer. In this review, we discuss the genetic variants of lncRNAs, 
      heterogeneous mechanisms of actions of lncRNAs in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis, and 
      drug resistance. We also highlight the recent developments in using lncRNAs as 
      potential prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. Lastly, we discuss potential 
      approaches for linking lncRNAs to future gene therapies, and highlight future 
      directions in the field of ovarian cancer research.

TI  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae Synthetic Transcriptional Networks Harnessing dCas12a and 
      Type V-A anti-CRISPR Proteins.
PG  - 870-883
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00006 [doi]
AB  - Type V-A anti-CRISPR proteins (AcrVAs) represent the response from phages to the 
      CRISPR-Cas12a prokaryotic immune system. CRISPR-Cas12a was repurposed, in high 
      eukaryotes, to carry out gene editing and transcription regulation, the latter via a 
      nuclease-dead Cas12a (dCas12a). Consequently, AcrVAs were adopted to regulate 
      (d)Cas12a activity. However, the usage of both dCas12a-based transcription factors 
      and AcrVAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has not been explored. In this 
      work, we show that, in the baker's yeast, two dCas12a proteins (denAsCas12a and 
      dLbCas12a) work both as activators (upon fusion to a strong activation domain) and 
      repressors, whereas dMbCa12a is nonfunctional. The activation efficiency of 
      dCas12a-ADs manifests a dependence on the number of crRNA binding sites, whereas it 
      is not directly correlated to the amount of crRNA in the cells. Moreover, AcrVA1, 
      AcrVA4, and AcrVA5 are able to inhibit dLbCa12a in yeast, and denAsCas12a is only 
      inhibited by AcrVA1. However, AcrVA1 performs well at high concentration only. 
      Coexpression of two or three AcrVAs does not enhance inhibition of dCas12a(-AD), 
      suggesting a competition between different AcrVAs. Further, AcrVA4 significantly 
      limits gene editing by LbCas12a. Overall, our results indicate that dCas12a:crRNA 
      and AcrVA proteins are highly performant components in S. cerevisiae synthetic 
      transcriptional networks.

AB  - Cell behavior is controlled by complex gene regulatory networks. Although studies 
      have uncovered diverse roles of individual genes, it has been challenging to record 
      or control sequential genetic events in living cells. In this study, we designed two 
      cellular chain reaction systems that enable sequential sgRNA activation in mammalian 
      cells using a nickase Cas9 tethering of a cytosine nucleotide deaminase (nCas9-CDA). 
      In these systems, thymidine (T)-to-cytosine (C) substitutions in the scaffold region 
      of the sgRNA or the TATA box-containing loxP sequence (TATAloxP) are corrected by 
      the nCas9-CDA, leading to activation of the next sgRNA. These reactions can occur 
      multiple times, resulting in cellular chain reactions. As a proof of concept, we 
      established a chain reaction by repairing sgRNA scaffold mutations in 293 T cells. 
      Importantly, the results obtained in yeast or in vitro did not match those obtained 
      in mammalian cells, suggesting that in vivo chain reactions need to be optimized in 
      appropriate cellular contexts. Our system may lay the foundation for building 
      cellular chain reaction systems that have a broad utility in the future biomedical 
      research.

AB  - Studies on the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of sea urchin embryos have provided a 
      basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling animal development. The 
      causal links in GRNs have been verified experimentally through perturbation of gene 
      functions. Microinjection of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) into the 
      egg is the most widely used approach for gene knockdown in sea urchin embryos. The 
      modification of MOs into a membrane-permeable form (vivo-MOs) has allowed gene 
      knockdown at later developmental stages. Recent advances in genome editing tools, 
      such as zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector-based nucleases 
      and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) system, have 
      provided methods for gene knockout in sea urchins. Here, we review the use of 
      vivo-MOs and genome editing tools in sea urchin studies since the publication of its 
      genome in 2006. Various applications of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and their potential 
      in studying sea urchin development are also discussed. These new tools will provide 
      more sophisticated experimental methods for studying sea urchin development.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9/phosphoproteomics identifies multiple noncanonical targets of myosin 
      light chain kinase.
PG  - F600-F616
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00431.2019 [doi]
AB  - Prior studies have implicated myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in the regulation of 
      aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal collecting duct. To discover signaling targets of 
      MLCK, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete the MLCK gene (Mylk) to obtain MLCK-null mpkCCD 
      cells and carried out comprehensive phosphoproteomics using stable isotope labeling 
      with amino acids in cell culture for quantification. Immunocytochemistry and 
      electron microscopy demonstrated a defect in the processing of AQP2-containing early 
      endosomes to late endosomes. The phosphoproteomics experiments revealed that, of the 
      1,743 phosphopeptides quantified over multiple replicates, 107 were changed in 
      abundance by MLCK deletion (29 decreased and 78 increased). One of the decreased 
      phosphopeptides corresponded to the canonical target site in myosin regulatory light 
      chain. Network analysis indicated that targeted phosphoproteins clustered into 
      distinct structural/functional groups: actomyosin, signaling, nuclear envelope, gene 
      transcription, mRNA processing, energy metabolism, intermediate filaments, adherens 
      junctions, and tight junctions. There was significant overlap between the derived 
      MLCK signaling network and a previously determined PKA signaling network. The 
      presence of multiple proteins in the actomyosin category prompted experiments 
      showing that MLCK deletion inhibits the normal effect of vasopressin to depolymerize 
      F-actin, providing a potential explanation for the AQP2 trafficking defect. Changes 
      in phosphorylation of multiple proteins in the nuclear envelope prompted measurement 
      of nuclear size, showing a significant increase in average nuclear volume. We 
      conclude that MLCK is part of a multicomponent signaling pathway in both the 
      cytoplasm and nucleus that includes much more than simple regulation of conventional 
      nonmuscle myosins through myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation.

AB  - AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical energy sensor, regulating 
      signaling networks involved in pathology including metabolic diseases and cancer. 
      This increasingly recognized role of AMPK has prompted tremendous research efforts 
      to develop new pharmacological AMPK activators. To precisely study the role of AMPK, 
      and the specificity and activity of AMPK activators in cellular models, genetic AMPK 
      inactivating tools are required. We report here methods for genetic inactivation of 
      AMPK α1/α2 catalytic subunits in human cell lines by the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, a 
      recent breakthrough technique for genome editing.

AB  - We present two algorithms to predict the activity of AsCpf1 guide RNAs. Indel 
      frequencies for 15,000 target sequences were used in a deep-learning framework based 
      on a convolutional neural network to train Seq-deepCpf1. We then incorporated 
      chromatin accessibility information to create the better-performing DeepCpf1 
      algorithm for cell lines for which such information is available and show that both 
      algorithms outperform previous machine learning algorithms on our own and published 
      data sets.

PG  - 315-319

AB  - The scientific journal Nature Methods have just retracted a publication that 
      reported numerous unexpected mutations after a CRISPR-Cas9 experiment based on 
      collecting whole genome sequencing information from one control and two experimental 
      genome edited mice. In the intervening 10 months since publication the data 
      presented have been strongly contested and criticized by the scientific and biotech 
      communities, through publications, open science channels and social networks. The 
      criticism focused on the animal used as control, which was derived from the same 
      mouse strain as the experimental individuals but from an unrelated sub-colony, hence 
      control and experimental mice were genetically divergent. The most plausible 
      explanation for the vast majority of the reported unexpected mutations were the 
      expected underlying genetic polymorphisms that normally accumulate in two different 
      colonies of the same mouse strain which occur as a result of spontaneous mutations 
      and genetic drift. Therefore, the reported mutations were most likely not related to 
      CRISPR-Cas9 activity.

TI  - Neuron-specific knockouts indicate the importance of network communication to 
      Drosophila rhythmicity.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.48301 [doi]
LID - e48301
AB  - Animal circadian rhythms persist in constant darkness and are driven by 
      intracellular transcription-translation feedback loops. Although these cellular 
      oscillators communicate, isolated mammalian cellular clocks continue to tick away in 
      darkness without intercellular communication. To investigate these issues in 
      Drosophila, we assayed behavior as well as molecular rhythms within individual brain 
      clock neurons while blocking communication within the ca. 150 neuron clock network. 
      We also generated CRISPR-mediated neuron-specific circadian clock knockouts. The 
      results point to two key clock neuron groups: loss of the clock within both regions 
      but neither one alone has a strong behavioral phenotype in darkness; communication 
      between these regions also contributes to circadian period determination. Under 
      these dark conditions, the clock within one region persists without network 
      communication. The clock within the famous PDF-expressing s-LNv neurons however was 
      strongly dependent on network communication, likely because clock gene expression 
      within these vulnerable sLNvs depends on neuronal firing or light.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are complex, multifactorial disorders 
      characterized by chronic relapsing intestinal inflammation. IBD is diagnosed around 
      1 in 1000 individuals in Western countries with globally increasing incident rates. 
      Association studies have identified hundreds of genes that are linked to IBD and 
      potentially regulate its pathology. The further dissection of the genetic network 
      underlining IBD pathogenesis and pathophysiology is hindered by the limited capacity 
      to functionally characterize each genetic association, including generating knockout 
      animal models for every associated gene. Cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9-based technology 
      may transform the field of IBD research by efficiently and effectively introducing 
      genetic alterations. In the present study, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies to 
      genetically modify hematopoietic stem cells. Through cell sorting and bone marrow 
      transplantation, we established a system to knock out target gene expression by over 
      90% in the immune system of reconstituted animals. Using a CD40-mediated colitis 
      model, we further validated our CRISPR/Cas9-based platform for investigating gene 
      function in experimental IBD. In doing so, we developed a model system that delivers 
      genetically modified mice in a manner much faster than conventional methodology, 
      significantly reducing the time from target identification to in vivo target 
      validation and expediting drug development.

AB  - Effective treatments targeting disease etiology are urgently needed for Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Although candidate AD genes have been identified and altering their 
      levels may serve as therapeutic strategies, the consequence of such alterations 
      remain largely unknown. Herein, we analyzed CRISPR knockout/RNAi knockdown screen 
      data for over 700 cell lines and evaluated cellular dependencies of 104 
      AD-associated genes previously identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
      and gene expression network studies. Multiple genes showed widespread cell 
      dependencies across tissue lineages, suggesting their inhibition may yield 
      off-target effects. Meanwhile, several genes including SPI1, MEF2C, GAB2, ABCC11, 
      ATCG1 were identified as genes of interest since their genetic knockouts 
      specifically affected high-expressing cells whose tissue lineages are relevant to 
      cell types found in AD. Overall, analyses of genetic screen data identified 
      AD-associated genes whose knockout or knockdown selectively affected cell lines of 
      relevant tissue lineages, prioritizing targets for potential AD treatments.

AB  - Chromatin accessibility profiling can identify putative regulatory regions genome 
      wide; however, pooled single-cell methods for assessing the effects of regulatory 
      perturbations on accessibility are limited. Here, we report a modified droplet-based 
      single-cell ATAC-seq protocol for perturbing and evaluating dynamic single-cell 
      epigenetic states. This method (Spear-ATAC) enables simultaneous read-out of 
      chromatin accessibility profiles and integrated sgRNA spacer sequences from 
      thousands of individual cells at once. Spear-ATAC profiling of 104,592 cells 
      representing 414 sgRNA knock-down populations reveals the temporal dynamics of 
      epigenetic responses to regulatory perturbations in cancer cells and the 
      associations between transcription factor binding profiles.

TI  - Efficient visual screening of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the nematode 
      Pristionchus pacificus.
PG  - 488-500
LID - 10.1111/dgd.12761 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has been applied to a wide variety of organisms, 
      including nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Pristionchus pacificus. In 
      these nematodes, genome editing is achieved by microinjection of Cas9 protein and 
      guide RNA into the hermaphrodite gonads. However, P. pacificus is less efficient in 
      CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and exogenous gene expression. Therefore, it takes 
      considerable time and effort to screen for target mutants if there are no visual 
      markers that indicate successful injection. To overcome this problem, co-injection 
      markers (gRNA for Ppa-prl-1, which induces the roller phenotype, and 
      Ppa-egl-20p::turboRFP, a plasmid expressing a fluorescent protein) have been 
      developed in P. pacificus. By selecting worms with the roller phenotype or turboRFP 
      expression, screening efficiency is substantially increased to obtain worms with 
      desired mutations. Here, we describe a step-by-step protocol for the visual 
      screening system for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in P. pacificus. We also describe 
      technical tips for microinjection, which is difficult for beginners. This protocol 
      will facilitate genome editing in P. pacificus and may be applied to other nematode 
      species.

PG  - 6452-6
LID - 10.1002/anie.201601708 [doi]
AB  - Targeted transcriptional activation of endogenous genes is important for 
      understanding physiological transcriptional networks, synthesizing genetic circuits, 
      and inducing cellular phenotype changes. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has great potential 
      to achieve this purpose, however, it has not yet been successfully used to 
      efficiently activate endogenous genes and induce changes in cellular phenotype. A 
      powerful method for transcriptional activation by using CRISPR/Cas9 was developed. 
      Replacement of a methylated promoter with an unmethylated one by CRISPR/Cas9 was 
      sufficient to activate the expression of the neural cell gene OLIG2 and the 
      embryonic stem cell gene NANOG in HEK293T cells. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-based OLIG2 
      activation induced the embryonic carcinoma cell line NTERA-2 to express the neuronal 
      marker βIII-tubulin.

TI  - Exploration of Hygromycin B Biosynthesis Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9-Associated Base 
      Editing.
PG  - 1417-1423
LID - 10.1021/acschembio.0c00071 [doi]
AB  - Hygromycin B is an aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used in industry and biological 
      research. However, most of its biosynthetic pathway has not been completely 
      identified due to the immense difficulty in genetic manipulation of the producing 
      strain. To address this problem, we developed an efficient system that combines 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-associated 
      base editing and site-specific recombination instead of conventional 
      double-crossover-based homologous recombination. This strategy was successfully 
      applied to the in vivo inactivation of five candidate genes involved in the 
      biosynthesis of hygromycin B by generating stop codons or mutating conserved 
      residues within the encoding region. The results revealed that HygJ, HygL, and HygD 
      are responsible for successive dehydrogenation, transamination, and 
      transglycosylation of nucleoside diphosphate (NDP)-heptose. Notably, HygY acts as an 
      unusual radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent epimerase for hydroxyl carbons, 
      and HygM serves as a versatile methyltransferase in multiple parallel metabolic 
      networks. Based on in vivo and in vitro evidence, the biosynthetic pathway for 
      hygromycin B is proposed.

TI  - Mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 is necessary for AML survival.
PG  - 81-92
LID - 10.1182/blood.2019000106 [doi]
AB  - Through a clustered regularly insterspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screen 
      to identify mitochondrial genes necessary for the growth of acute myeloid leukemia 
      (AML) cells, we identified the mitochondrial outer membrane protein mitochondrial 
      carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2). In AML, knockdown of MTCH2 decreased growth, reduced 
      engraftment potential of stem cells, and induced differentiation. Inhibiting MTCH2 
      in AML cells increased nuclear pyruvate and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which 
      induced histone acetylation and subsequently promoted the differentiation of AML 
      cells. Thus, we have defined a new mechanism by which mitochondria and metabolism 
      regulate AML stem cells and gene expression.

TI  - Lysogeny is prevalent and widely distributed in the murine gut microbiota.
PG  - 1127-1141
LID - 10.1038/s41396-018-0061-9 [doi]
AB  - Bacteriophages are central members and potential modulators of the gut microbiome; 
      however, the ecological and evolutionary relationships of gut bacteria and phages 
      are poorly understood. Here we investigated the abundance and diversity of lysogenic 
      bacteria (lysogens) in the bacterial community of C57BL/6J mice by detecting 
      integrated prophages in genomes reconstructed from the metagenome of commensal 
      bacteria. For the activities of lysogens and prophages, we compared the prophage 
      genomes with the metagenome of free phages. The majority of commensal bacteria in 
      different taxa were identified as lysogens. More lysogens were found among 
      Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, than among Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The 
      prophage genomes shared high sequence similarity with the metagenome of free phages, 
      indicating that most lysogens appeared to be active, and that prophages are 
      spontaneously induced as active phages; dietary interventions changed the 
      composition of the induced prophages. By contrast, CRISPR-Cas systems were present 
      in few commensal bacteria, and were rarely active against gut phages. The structure 
      of the bacteria-phage infection networks was "nested-modular", with modularity 
      emerging across taxonomic scales, indicating that temperate phage features have 
      developed over a long phylogenetic timescale. We concluded that phage generalists 
      contribute to the prevalence of lysogeny in the gut ecosystem.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with poor prognosis. 
      New options for drug discovery targets are needed. We developed an imaging based 
      arrayed CRISPR method to interrogate the human genome for modulation of in vitro 
      correlates of AD features, and used this to assess 1525 human genes related to tau 
      aggregation, autophagy and mitochondria. This work revealed (I) a network of tau 
      aggregation modulators including the NF-κB pathway and inflammatory signaling, (II) 
      a correlation between mitochondrial morphology, respiratory function and 
      transcriptomics, (III) machine learning predicted novel roles of genes and pathways 
      in autophagic processes and (IV) individual gene function inferences and 
      interactions among biological processes via multi-feature clustering. These studies 
      provide a platform to interrogate underexplored aspects of AD biology and offer 
      several specific hypotheses for future drug discovery efforts.

AB  - Embryogenesis, as well as regeneration, is increasingly recognized to be 
      orchestrated by an interplay of transcriptional and bioelectric networks. 
      Spatiotemporal patterns of resting potentials direct the size, shape, and locations 
      of numerous organ primordia during patterning. These bioelectrical properties are 
      established by the function of ion channels and pumps that set voltage potentials of 
      individual cells, and gap junctions (electrical synapses) that enable physiological 
      states to propagate across tissue networks. Functional experiments to probe the 
      roles of bioelectrical states can be carried out by targeting endogenous ion 
      channels during development. Here, we describe protocols, optimized for the highly 
      tractable Xenopus laevis embryo, for molecular genetic targeting of ion channels and 
      connexins based on CRISPR, and monitoring of resting potential states using 
      voltage-sensing fluorescent dye. Similar strategies can be adapted to other model 
      species.

TI  - Guide-target mismatch effects on dCas9-sgRNA binding activity in living bacterial 
      cells.
PG  - 1263-1277
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa1295 [doi]
AB  - As an effective programmable DNA targeting tool, CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adopted 
      in varieties of biotechnological applications. However, the off-target effects, 
      derived from the tolerance towards guide-target mismatches, are regarded as the 
      major problems in engineering CRISPR systems. To understand this, we constructed two 
      sgRNA libraries carrying saturated single- and double-nucleotide mismatches in 
      living bacteria cells, and profiled the comprehensive landscape of in vivo binding 
      affinity of dCas9 toward DNA target guided by each individual sgRNA with particular 
      mismatches. We observed a synergistic effect in seed, where combinatorial double 
      mutations caused more severe activity loss compared with the two corresponding 
      single mutations. Moreover, we found that a particular mismatch type, dDrG (D = A, 
      T, G), only showed moderate impairment on binding. To quantitatively understand the 
      causal relationship between mismatch and binding behaviour of dCas9, we further 
      established a biophysical model, and found that the thermodynamic properties of 
      base-pairing coupled with strand invasion process, to a large extent, can account 
      for the observed mismatch-activity landscape. Finally, we repurposed this model, 
      together with a convolutional neural network constructed based on the same 
      mechanism, as a predictive tool to guide the rational design of sgRNA in bacterial 
      CRISPR interference.

AB  - During steady-state cell growth, individual enzymatic fluxes can be directly 
      inferred from growth rate by mass conservation, but the inverse problem remains 
      unsolved. Perturbing the flux and expression of a single enzyme could have 
      pleiotropic effects that may or may not dominate the impact on cell fitness. Here, 
      we quantitatively dissect the molecular and global responses to varied expression of 
      translation termination factors (peptide release factors, RFs) in the bacterium 
      Bacillus subtilis. While endogenous RF expression maximizes proliferation, 
      deviations in expression lead to unexpected distal regulatory responses that dictate 
      fitness reduction. Molecularly, RF depletion causes expression imbalance at specific 
      operons, which activates master regulators and detrimentally overrides the 
      transcriptome. Through these spurious connections, RF abundances are thus entrenched 
      by focal points within the regulatory network, in one case located at a single stop 
      codon. Such regulatory entrenchment suggests that predictive bottom-up models of 
      expression-fitness landscapes will require near-exhaustive characterization of 
      parts.

AB  - In the human hematopoietic system, rare self-renewing multipotent long-term 
      hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) are responsible for the lifelong production of 
      mature blood cells and are the rational target for clinical regenerative therapies. 
      However, the heterogeneity in the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and variable 
      outcomes of CRISPR/Cas9 editing make functional interrogation of rare LT-HSCs 
      challenging. Here, we report high efficiency LT-HSC editing at single-cell 
      resolution using electroporation of modified synthetic gRNAs and Cas9 protein. 
      Targeted short isoform expression of the GATA1 transcription factor elicit distinct 
      differentiation and proliferation effects in single highly purified LT-HSC when 
      analyzed with functional in vitro differentiation and long-term repopulation 
      xenotransplantation assays. Our method represents a blueprint for systematic genetic 
      analysis of complex tissue hierarchies at single-cell resolution.

AB  - Bacteriophages express proteins that inactivate the CRISPR-Cas bacterial immune 
      system. Here we report the crystal structure of the anti-CRISPR protein AcrF3 in 
      complex with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cas3 (PaCas3). AcrF3 forms a homodimer that 
      locks PaCas3 in an ADP-bound form, blocks the entrance of the DNA-binding tunnel in 
      the helicase domain, and masks the linker region and C-terminal domain of PaCas3, 
      thereby preventing recruitment by Cascade and inhibiting the type I-F CRISPR-Cas 
      system.

AB  - The auxin-inducible degron (AID) system is a robust chemical-genetic method for 
      manipulating endogenous protein level by conditional proteasomal degradation via a 
      small molecule. So far, this system has not been adapted in the P. yoelii, an 
      important and widely used Plasmodium rodent parasite model for malaria biology. 
      Here, using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing method, we generated two marker-free 
      transgenic P. yoelii parasite lines (eef1a-Tir1 and soap-Tir1) stably expressing the 
      Oryza sativa gene tir1 under the promoters of eef1a and soap respectively. These two 
      lines develop normally during the parasite life cycle. In these backgrounds, we used 
      the CRISPR/Cas9 method to tag two genes (cdc50c and fbxo1) with the AID motif and 
      interrogate the expression of these two proteins with auxin. The eef1a-Tir1 line 
      allows efficient degradation of the AID-tagged endogenous protein in the asexual 
      schizont and sexual gametocyte stages, while the soap-Tir1 line allows protein 
      degradation in the ookinetes. These two lines will be a useful resource for studying 
      the Plasmodium parasite biology based on the P. yoelii.

AB  - CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) activation 
      (CRISPRa) in bacteria is an attractive method for programmable gene activation. 
      Recently, a eukaryote-like, σ(54) -dependent CRISPRa system has been reported. It 
      exhibits high dynamic ranges and permits flexible target site selection. Here, an 
      overview of the existing strategies of CRISPRa in bacteria is presented, and the 
      characteristics and design principles of the CRISPRa system are introduced. Possible 
      scenarios for applying the eukaryote-like CRISPRa system is discussed with 
      corresponding suggestions for performance optimization and future functional 
      expansion. The authors envision the new eukaryote-like CRISPRa system enabling novel 
      designs in multiplexed gene regulation and promoting research in the σ(54) 
      -dependent gene regulatory networks among a variety of biotechnology relevant or 
      disease-associated bacterial species.

      total of 108 genes were upregulated and 178 downregulated between the samples, above 
      and below the baseline respectively. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis reveal 
      distinct biological processes and pathways. Analysis of gene regulatory networks 
      also gave different network patterns in the two samples. We confirmed the RNA 
      sequencing data for 10 genes; IFIF27, SMAD3, COX11, TP53INP1, ABL2, FGF8, TNFAIP3, 
      NRG1, SP3 and MDM4 by Real-time PCR. This is the first report on the effect of 
      miR-214 on global mRNA profile in cervical cancer cells. This study also reports new 
      biomarkers for cervical cancer prognosis.

AB  - Programmable and precise regulation of dCas9 functions in response to multiple 
      molecular signals by using synthetic gene circuits will expand the application of 
      the CRISPR-Cas technology. However, the application of CRISPR-Cas therapeutic 
      circuits is still challenging due to the restrictive cargo size of existing viral 
      delivery vehicles. Here, we construct logic AND circuits by integrating multiple 
      split dCas9 domains, which is useful to reduce the size of synthetic circuits. In 
      addition, we engineer sensory switches by exchanging split dCas9 domains, allowing 
      differential regulations on one gene, or activating two different genes in response 
      to cell-type specific microRNAs. Therefore, we provide a valuable split-dCas9 
      toolkit to engineer complex transcription controls, which may inspire new biomedical 
      applications.

AB  - A network of intersecting molecular pathways interacts to initiate and execute axon 
      destruction. Maximum protection against axon degeneration likely requires more than 
      manipulation of a single target. Here, we describe the process of designing a 
      high-throughput arrayed screening assay for the identification of key factors 
      responsible for axon destruction and/or protection. First, we go over some existing 
      screens in the literature, then discuss the planning, tracking, analysis, and 
      statistics around such a screening experiment. Prioritization of perturbations may 
      allow laboratories to cost-effectively explore the process of screening. We also 
      present the pairing of a combinatorial drug screen with a machine learning 
      algorithm, predicting how to best modulate neurodegenerative and neuroprotective 
      components.

TI  - Interactions in the ESCRT-III network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 607-619
LID - 10.1007/s00294-018-0915-8 [doi]
AB  - Here, we examine the genetic interactions between ESCRT-III mutations in the yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. From the obtained interaction network, we make predictions 
      about alternative ESCRT-III complexes. By the successful generation of an octuple 
      deletion strain using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we demonstrate for the first time 
      that ESCRT-III activity as a whole is not essential for the life of a yeast cell. 
      Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III proteins are membrane 
      remodeling factors involved in a multitude of cellular processes. There are eight 
      proteins in yeast with an ESCRT-III domain. It is not clear whether the diverse 
      ESCRT-III functions are fulfilled by a single ESCRT-III complex or by different 
      complexes with distinct composition. Genetic interaction studies may provide a hint 
      on the existence of alternative complexes. We performed a genetic mini-array screen 
      by analyzing the growth phenotypes of all pairwise combinations of ESCRT-III 
      deletion mutations under different stress conditions. Our analysis is in line with 
      previous data pointing to a complex containing Did2/CHMP1 and Ist1/IST1. In 
      addition, we provide evidence for the existence of a novel complex consisting of 
      Did2/CHMP1 and Vps2/CHMP2. Some of the interactions on Congo red plates could be 
      explained by effects of ESCRT-III mutations on Rim101 signaling.

TI  - An Interplay between Viruses and Bacteria Associated with the White Sea Sponges 
      Revealed by Metagenomics.
LID - 10.3390/life12010025 [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - Sponges are remarkable holobionts harboring extremely diverse microbial and viral 
      communities. However, the interactions between the components within holobionts and 
      between a holobiont and environment are largely unknown, especially for polar 
      organisms. To investigate possible interactions within and between sponge-associated 
      communities, we probed the microbiomes and viromes of cold-water sympatric sponges 
      Isodictya palmata (n = 2), Halichondria panicea (n = 3), and Halichondria sitiens (n 
      = 3) by 16S and shotgun metagenomics. We showed that the bacterial and viral 
      communities associated with these White Sea sponges are species-specific and 
      different from the surrounding water. Extensive mining of bacterial antiphage 
      defense systems in the metagenomes revealed a variety of defense mechanisms. The 
      abundance of defense systems was comparable in the metagenomes of the sponges and 
      the surrounding water, thus distinguishing the White Sea sponges from those 
      inhabiting the tropical seas. We developed a network-based approach for the combined 
      analysis of CRISPR-spacers and protospacers. Using this approach, we showed that the 
      virus-host interactions within the sponge-associated community are typically more 
      abundant (three out of four interactions studied) than the inter-community 
      interactions. Additionally, we detected the occurrence of viral exchanges between 
      the communities. Our work provides the first insight into the metagenomics of the 
      three cold-water sponge species from the White Sea and paves the way for a 
      comprehensive analysis of the interactions between microbial communities and 
      associated viruses.

TI  - Genome analysis of lactic acid bacterial strains selected as potential starters for 
      traditional Slovakian bryndza cheese.
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fny257 [doi]
AB  - Genomes of 21 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Slovakian traditional 
      cheeses were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Subsequently, they were 
      analysed regarding taxonomic classification, presence of genes encoding defence 
      systems, antibiotic resistance and production of biogenic amines. Thirteen strains 
      were found to carry genes encoding at least one bacteriocin, 18 carried genes 
      encoding at least one restriction-modification system, all strains carried 1-6 
      prophages and 9 strains had CRISPR-Cas systems. CRISPR-Cas type II-A was the most 
      common, containing 0-24 spacers. Only 10% spacers were found to be homological to 
      known bacteriophage or plasmid sequences in databases. Two Enterococcus faecium 
      strains and a Lactococcus lactis strain carried antibiotic resistance genes. Genes 
      encoding for ornithine decarboxylase were detected in four strains and genes 
      encoding for agmatine deiminase were detected in four strains. Lactobacillus 
      paraplantarum 251 L appeared to be the most interesting strain, as it contained 
      genes encoding for two bacteriocins, a restriction-modification system, two 
      CRISPR-Cas systems, four prophages and no genes connected with antibiotic resistance 
      or production of biogenic amines.

AB  - Liver-targeted genome editing offers the prospect of life-long therapeutic benefit 
      following a single treatment and is set to rapidly supplant conventional gene 
      addition approaches. Combining progress in liver-targeted gene delivery with genome 
      editing technology, makes this not only feasible but realistically achievable in the 
      near term. However, important challenges remain to be addressed. These include 
      achieving therapeutic levels of editing, particularly in vivo, avoidance of 
      off-target effects on the genome and the potential impact of pre-existing immunity 
      to bacteria-derived nucleases, when used to improve editing rates. In this chapter, 
      we outline the unique features of the liver that make it an attractive target for 
      genome editing, the impact of liver biology on therapeutic efficacy, and disease 
      specific challenges, including whether the approach targets a cell autonomous or 
      non-cell autonomous disease. We also discuss strategies that have been used 
      successfully to achieve genome editing outcomes in the liver and address 
      translational considerations as genome editing technology moves into the clinic.

AB  - Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is essential for the type I interferon 
      response induced by microbial DNA from virus or self-DNA from mitochondria/nuclei. 
      In response to emergence of such DNAs in the cytosol, STING translocates from the 
      endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, and activates TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) at 
      the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Activated TBK1 then phosphorylates STING at Ser365, 
      generating an interferon regulatory factor 3-docking site on STING. How this 
      reaction proceeds specifically at the TGN remains poorly understood. Here we report 
      a cell-free reaction in which endogenous STING is phosphorylated by TBK1. The 
      reaction utilizes microsomal membrane fraction prepared from TBK1-knockout cells and 
      recombinant TBK1. We observed agonist-, TBK1-, "ER-to-Golgi" traffic-, and 
      palmitoylation-dependent phosphorylation of STING at Ser365, mirroring the nature of 
      STING phosphorylation in vivo. Treating the microsomal membrane fraction with 
      sphingomyelinase or methyl-β-cyclodextrin, an agent to extract cholesterol from 
      membranes, suppressed the phosphorylation of STING by TBK1. Given the enrichment of 
      sphingomyelin and cholesterol in the TGN, these results may provide the molecular 
      basis underlying the specific phosphorylation reaction of STING at the TGN.

TI  - Integrative network analysis reveals USP7 haploinsufficiency inhibits E-protein 
      activity in pediatric T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

AB  - USP7, which encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme, is among the most frequently mutated 
      genes in pediatric T-ALL, with somatic heterozygous loss-of-function mutations 
      (haploinsufficiency) predominantly affecting the subgroup that has aberrant TAL1 
      oncogene activation. Network analysis of > 200 T-ALL transcriptomes linked USP7 
      haploinsufficiency with decreased activities of E-proteins. E-proteins are also 
      negatively regulated by TAL1, leading to concerted down-regulation of E-protein 
      target genes involved in T-cell development. In T-ALL cell lines, we showed the 
      physical interaction of USP7 with E-proteins and TAL1 by mass spectrometry and 
      ChIP-seq. Haploinsufficient but not complete CRISPR knock-out of USP7 showed 
      accelerated cell growth and validated transcriptional down-regulation of E-protein 
      targets. Our study unveiled the synergistic effect of USP7 haploinsufficiency with 
      aberrant TAL1 activation on T-ALL, implicating USP7 as a haploinsufficient tumor 
      suppressor in T-ALL. Our findings caution against a universal oncogene designation 
      for USP7 while emphasizing the dosage-dependent consequences of USP7 inhibitors 
      currently under development as potential cancer therapeutics.

PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1007/978-1-0716-0680-3_1 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene 
      expression networks. Over 50,000 lncRNA loci have been annotated in the human 
      genome, but only a subset has been involved in regulation of key cellular processes, 
      organismal development, and diseases. Hence, the functional role for the majority of 
      the lncRNA genes remains unknown. With the recent developments of different 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, the function of lncRNAs can now be examined. CRISPR 
      interference (CRISPRi) is one of these methods that can be used to inhibit the 
      expression of any genomic locus including lncRNAs. This system utilizes 
      catalytically inactive (d)Cas9 fused to KRAB repression domain and single guide RNA 
      against targeted genomic locus. Since CRISPRi has negligible off-target effects and 
      does not involve changes in the underlying genomic DNA sequence, it represents a 
      valuable addition to the existing armamentarium used to investigate lncRNA biology.

      activation.
PG  - 2238-2247
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.13127 [doi]
AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have a wide range of applications in early human 
      embryonic development mimics, disease modeling, and cell therapy. To fulfill these 
      applications, we established hESCs for inducible and multiplex orthogonal gene 
      knockout and activation, which we named iKA-CRISPR hESCs. In cells, when complexed 
      with a short guide RNA containing a 14-bp target sequence (14-bp gRNA) or a long 
      20-bp gRNA, the doxycycline-induced Cas9-p300 protein could activate gene 
      transcription or cleave genomic DNA, respectively. We also demonstrate using 
      iKA-CRISPR hESCs that knockout of OCT4 promoted differentiation, and developmentally 
      relevant microRNAs and transcription factors could be efficiently activated. Thus, 
      iKA-CRISPR hESCs provide a convenient platform to control gene expression networks

AB  - We aim to characterize the expression of RNA panel in HCC. We assessed the 
      expression of HCC-associated mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA network by real time PCR in sera 
      and tissue samples. In a proof-of-principle approach, CRISPR cas9 mediated knock out 
      for lncRNA- RP11-156p1.3 was performed in HEPG2 cell line to validate the role of 
      the chosen RNA in HCC pathogenesis. The differential expression of RFTN1 mRNA, 
      lncRNA- RP11-156p1.3 and miRNA-4764-5p was statistically different among the studied 
      groups. After CRISPR cas9 mediated knockout of lncRNA- RP11-156p1.3 in HEPG2 cells, 
      there was significant decrease in cell count and viability with reversal of the 
      expression of the chosen RNAs. The chosen RNAs play a significant role in HCC 
      pathogenesis and may be potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Designing an optimal microbial cell factory often requires overexpression, 
      knock-down, and knock-out of multiple gene targets. Unfortunately, such rewiring of 
      cellular metabolism is often carried out sequentially and with low throughput. Here, 
      we report a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy based on an orthogonal 
      tri-functional CRISPR system that combines transcriptional activation, 
      transcriptional interference, and gene deletion (CRISPR-AID) in the yeast 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This strategy enables perturbation of the metabolic and 
      regulatory networks in a modular, parallel, and high-throughput manner. We 
      demonstrate the application of CRISPR-AID not only to increase the production of 
      β-carotene by 3-fold in a single step, but also to achieve 2.5-fold improvement in 
      the display of an endoglucanase on the yeast surface by optimizing multiple 
      metabolic engineering targets in a combinatorial manner.

AB  - Tissue-specific transcriptional programs control most biological phenotypes, 
      including disease states such as cancer. However, the molecular details underlying 
      transcriptional specificity is largely unknown, hindering the development of 
      therapeutic approaches. Here, we describe novel experimental reporter systems that 
      allow interrogation of the endogenous expression of HIF2A, a critical driver of 
      renal oncogenesis. Using a focused CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting chromatin 
      regulators, we provide evidence that these reporter systems are compatible with 
      high-throughput screening. Our data also suggests redundancy in the control of 
      cancer type-specific transcriptional traits. Reporter systems such as those 
      described here could facilitate large-scale mechanistic dissection of 
      transcriptional programmes underlying cancer phenotypes, thus paving the way for 
      novel therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are a pathological hallmark of more 
      than 20 distinct neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, 
      progressive supranuclear palsy, and frontotemporal dementia. While the exact 
      mechanism of tau aggregation is unknown, the accumulation of aggregates correlates 
      with disease progression. Here we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify 
      modulators of endogenous tau protein for the first time. Primary screens performed 
      in SH-SY5Y cells, identified positive and negative regulators of tau protein levels. 
      Hit validation of the top 43 candidate genes was performed using Ngn2-induced human 
      cortical excitatory neurons. Using this approach, genes and pathways involved in 
      modulation of endogenous tau levels were identified, including chromatin modifying 
      enzymes, neddylation and ubiquitin pathway members, and components of the mTOR 
      pathway. TSC1, a critical component of the mTOR pathway, was further validated in 
      vivo, demonstrating the relevance of this screening strategy. These findings may 
      have implications for treating neurodegenerative diseases in the future.

AB  - Deep-learning (DL)-based image processing has potential to revolutionize the use of 
      smartphones in mobile health (mHealth) diagnostics of infectious diseases. However, 
      the high variability in cellphone image data acquisition and the common need for 
      large amounts of specialist-annotated images for traditional DL model training may 
      preclude generalizability of smartphone-based diagnostics. Here, we employed 
      adversarial neural networks with conditioning to develop an easily reconfigurable 
      virus diagnostic platform that leverages a dataset of smartphone-taken microfluidic 
      chip photos to rapidly generate image classifiers for different target pathogens 
      on-demand. Adversarial learning was also used to augment this real image dataset by 
      generating 16,000 realistic synthetic microchip images, through style generative 
      adversarial networks (StyleGAN). We used this platform, termed smartphone-based 
      pathogen detection resource multiplier using adversarial networks (SPyDERMAN), to 
      accurately detect different intact viruses in clinical samples and to detect viral 
      nucleic acids through integration with CRISPR diagnostics. We evaluated the 
      performance of the system in detecting five different virus targets using 179 
      patient samples. The generalizability of the system was confirmed by rapid 
      reconfiguration to detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in nasal swab samples (n = 62) with 
      100% accuracy. Overall, the SPyDERMAN system may contribute to epidemic preparedness 
      strategies by providing a platform for smartphone-based diagnostics that can be 
      adapted to a given emerging viral agent within days of work.

TI  - Assessing Public Opinion on CRISPR-Cas9: Combining Crowdsourcing and Deep Learning.
PG  - e17830

LID - e17830
AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing method has opened 
      unprecedented new potential for biological and medical engineering, sparking a 
      growing public debate on both the potential and dangers of CRISPR applications. 
      Given the speed of technology development and the almost instantaneous global spread 
      of news, it is important to follow evolving debates without much delay and in 
      sufficient detail, as certain events may have a major long-term impact on public 
      opinion and later influence policy decisions. OBJECTIVE: Social media networks such 
      as Twitter have shown to be major drivers of news dissemination and public 
      discourse. They provide a vast amount of semistructured data in almost real-time and 
      give direct access to the content of the conversations. We can now mine and analyze 
      such data quickly because of recent developments in machine learning and natural 
      language processing. METHODS: Here, we used Bidirectional Encoder Representations 
      from Transformers (BERT), an attention-based transformer model, in combination with 
      statistical methods to analyze the entirety of all tweets ever published on CRISPR 
      since the publication of the first gene editing application in 2013. RESULTS: We 
      show that the mean sentiment of tweets was initially very positive, but began to 
      decrease over time, and that this decline was driven by rare peaks of strong 
      negative sentiments. Due to the high temporal resolution of the data, we were able 
      to associate these peaks with specific events and to observe how trending topics 
      changed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this type of analysis can provide valuable 
      and complementary insights into ongoing public debates, extending the traditional 
      empirical bioethics toolset.

AB  - The Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated 
      protein 9 (Cas9) system holds great promise for the cancer gene therapy. However, 
      due to complicated signal networks and various compensatory mechanisms in tumors, 
      adjusting a single molecular pathway has limited effects on cancer treatments. 
      Herein, a virus-like nanoparticle (VLN) was reported as a versatile nanoplatform to 
      co-deliver CRISPR/Cas9 system and small molecule drugs for effective malignant 
      cancer treatment. VLN has a core-shell structure, in which small molecule drugs and 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system are loaded in the mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based 
      core, which is further encapsulated with a lipid shell. This structure allows VLN 
      maintaining stable during blood circulation. As reaching tumors, VLN releases the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system and small molecule drugs in response to the reductive 
      microenvironment, resulting in the synergistic regulation of multiple 
      cancer-associated pathways. By loading a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting 
      programmed death-ligand 1 and axitinib, VLN achieved to disrupt multiple 
      immunosuppressive pathways and suppress the growth of melanoma in vivo. More 
      importantly, VLN can co-deliver almost any combination of sgRNAs and small molecule 
      drugs to tumors, suggesting the great potential of VLN as a general platform for the 
      development of advanced combination therapies against malignant tumors.

AB  - Ras is the most commonly mutated oncogene in humans and uses three oncogenic 
      effectors: Raf, PI3K, and RalGEF activation of Ral. Understanding the importance of 
      RalGEF>Ral signaling in cancer is hampered by the paucity of knowledge about their 
      function in animal development, particularly in cell movements. We found that 
      mutations that disrupt function of RalGEF or Ral enhance migration phenotypes of 
      mutants for genes with established roles in cell migration. We used as a model the 
      migration of the canal associated neurons (CANs), and validated our results in HSN 
      cell migration, neurite guidance, and general animal locomotion. These functions of 
      RalGEF and Ral are specific to their control of Ral signaling output rather than 
      other published functions of these proteins. In this capacity Ral functions cell 
      autonomously as a permissive developmental signal. In contrast, we observed Ras, the 
      canonical activator of RalGEF>Ral signaling in cancer, to function as an instructive 
      signal. Furthermore, we unexpectedly identified a function for the close Ras 
      relative, Rap1, consistent with activation of RalGEF>Ral. These studies define 
      functions of RalGEF>Ral, Rap1 and Ras signaling in morphogenetic processes that 
      fashion the nervous system. We have also defined a model for studying how small 
      GTPases partner with downstream effectors. Taken together, this analysis defines 
      novel molecules and relationships in signaling networks that control cell movements 
      during development of the nervous system.

AB  - Cancer genomes often harbor hundreds of molecular aberrations. Such genetic variants 
      can be drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis and create vulnerabilities for 
      potential therapeutic exploitation. To identify genotype-dependent vulnerabilities, 
      forward genetic screens in different genetic backgrounds have been conducted. We 
      devised MINGLE, a computational framework to integrate CRISPR/Cas9 screens 
      originating from different libraries building on approaches pioneered for genetic 
      network discovery in model organisms. We applied this method to integrate and 
      analyze data from 85 CRISPR/Cas9 screens in human cancer cells combining functional 
      data with information on genetic variants to explore more than 2.1 million 
      gene-background relationships. In addition to known dependencies, we identified new 
      genotype-specific vulnerabilities of cancer cells. Experimental validation of 
      predicted vulnerabilities identified GANAB and PRKCSH as new positive regulators of 
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling. By clustering genes with similar genetic interaction 
      profiles, we drew the largest genetic network in cancer cells to date. Our scalable 
      approach highlights how diverse genetic screens can be integrated to systematically 
      build informative maps of genetic interactions in cancer, which can grow dynamically 
      as more data are included.

AB  - cis-regulatory elements (CREs) regulate the expression of genes in their genomic 
      neighborhoods and influence cellular processes such as cell-fate maintenance and 
      differentiation. To date, there remain major gaps in the functional characterization 
      of CREs and the identification of their target genes in the cellular native 
      environment. In this study, we perform a features-oriented CRISPR-utilized 
      systematic (FOCUS) screen of OCT4-bound CREs using CRISPR-Cas9 to identify 
      functional enhancers important for pluripotency maintenance in mESCs. From the 
      initial 235 candidates tested, 16 CREs are identified to be essential stem cell 
      enhancers. Using RNA-seq and genomic 4C-seq, we further uncover a complex network of 
      candidate CREs and their downstream target genes, which supports the growth and 
      self-renewal of mESCs. Notably, an essential enhancer, CRE111, and its target, 
      Lrrc31, form the important switch to modulate the LIF-JAK1-STAT3 signaling pathway.

AB  - To construct a superior microbial cell factory for chemical synthesis, a major 
      challenge is to fully exploit cellular potential by identifying and engineering 
      beneficial gene targets in sophisticated metabolic networks. Here, we take advantage 
      of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and omics analyses to systematically identify 
      beneficial genes that can be engineered to promote free fatty acids (FFAs) 
      production in Escherichia coli. CRISPRi-mediated genetic perturbation enables the 
      identification of 30 beneficial genes from 108 targets related to FFA metabolism. 
      Then, omics analyses of the FFAs-overproducing strains and a control strain enable 
      the identification of another 26 beneficial genes that are seemingly irrelevant to 
      FFA metabolism. Combinatorial perturbation of four beneficial genes involving 
      cellular stress responses results in a recombinant strain 
      ihfA(L-)-aidB(+)-ryfA(M-)-gadA(H-), producing 30.0 g L(-1) FFAs in fed-batch 
      fermentation, the maximum titer in E. coli reported to date. Our findings are of 
      help in rewiring cellular metabolism and interwoven intracellular processes to 
      facilitate high-titer production of biochemicals.

PG  - 7791-7805
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkab535 [doi]
AB  - The industrial yeast Pichia pastoris has been harnessed extensively for production 
      of proteins, and it is attracting attention as a chassis cell factory for production 
      of chemicals. However, the lack of synthetic biology tools makes it challenging in 
      rewiring P. pastoris metabolism. We here extensively engineered the recombination 
      machinery by establishing a CRISPR-Cas9 based genome editing platform, which 
      improved the homologous recombination (HR) efficiency by more than 54 times, in 
      particular, enhanced the simultaneously assembly of multiple fragments by 13.5 
      times. We also found that the key HR-relating gene RAD52 of P. pastoris was largely 
      repressed in compared to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene editing system 
      enabled efficient seamless gene disruption, genome integration and multiple gene 
      assembly with positive rates of 68-90%. With this efficient genome editing platform, 
      we characterized 46 potential genome integration sites and 18 promoters at different 
      growth conditions. This library of neutral sites and promoters enabled two-factorial 
      regulation of gene expression and metabolic pathways and resulted in a 30-fold range 
      of fatty alcohol production (12.6-380 mg/l). The expanding genetic toolbox will 
      facilitate extensive rewiring of P. pastoris for chemical production, and also shed 
      light on engineering of other non-conventional yeasts.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of SHANK3 in monkey leads to drug-treatable 
      autism-like symptoms.

AB  - Monogenic mutations in the SHANK3 gene, which encodes a postsynaptic scaffold 
      protein, play a causative role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although a number 
      of mouse models with Shank3 mutations have been valuable for investigating the 
      pathogenesis of ASD, species-dependent differences in behaviors and brain structures 
      post considerable challenges to use small animals to model ASD and to translate 
      experimental therapeutics to the clinic. We have used clustered regularly 
      interspersed short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 to generate a 
      cynomolgus monkey model by disrupting SHANK3 at exons 6 and 12. Analysis of the live 
      mutant monkey revealed the core behavioral abnormalities of ASD, including impaired 
      social interaction and repetitive behaviors, and reduced brain network activities 
      detected by positron-emission computed tomography (PET). Importantly, these abnormal 
      behaviors and brain activities were alleviated by the antidepressant fluoxetine 
      treatment. Our findings provide the first demonstration that the genetically 
      modified non-human primate can be used for translational research of therapeutics 
      for ASD.

TI  - Paralog dependency indirectly affects the robustness of human cells.
PG  - e8871
LID - 10.15252/msb.20198871 [doi]
LID - e8871
AB  - The protective redundancy of paralogous genes partly relies on the fact that they 
      carry their functions independently. However, a significant fraction of paralogous 
      proteins may form functionally dependent pairs, for instance, through 
      heteromerization. As a consequence, one could expect these heteromeric paralogs to 
      be less protective against deleterious mutations. To test this hypothesis, we 
      examined the robustness landscape of gene loss-of-function by CRISPR-Cas9 in more 
      than 450 human cell lines. This landscape shows regions of greater deleteriousness 
      to gene inactivation as a function of key paralog properties. Heteromeric paralogs 
      are more likely to occupy such regions owing to their high expression and large 
      number of protein-protein interaction partners. Further investigation revealed that 
      heteromers may also be under stricter dosage balance, which may also contribute to 
      the higher deleteriousness upon gene inactivation. Finally, we suggest that physical 
      dependency may contribute to the deleteriousness upon loss-of-function as revealed 
      by the correlation between the strength of interactions between paralogs and their 
      higher deleteriousness upon loss of function.

AB  - Regulatory genes are often multifunctional and constrained, which results in 
      evolutionary conservation. It is difficult to understand how a regulatory gene could 
      be lost from one species' genome when it is essential for viability in closely 
      related species. The gene paired is a classic Drosophila pair-rule gene, required 
      for formation of alternate body segments in diverse insect species. Surprisingly, 
      paired was lost in mosquitoes without disrupting body patterning. Here, we 
      demonstrate that a paired family member, gooseberry, has acquired paired-like 
      expression in the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi. Anopheles-gooseberry 
      CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out mutants display pair-rule phenotypes and alteration of target 
      gene expression similar to what is seen in Drosophila and beetle paired mutants. 
      Thus, paired was functionally replaced by the related gene, gooseberry, in 
      mosquitoes. Our findings document a rare example of a functional replacement of an 
      essential regulatory gene and provide a mechanistic explanation of how such loss can 
      occur.

AB  - Gene regulatory networks that control pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells 
      (hESCs) are of considerable interest for regenerative medicine. RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 
      technologies have allowed the identification of hESC regulators on a genome-wide 
      scale. However, these technologies are ill-suited for mechanistic studies because 
      knockdown/knockout clones of essential genes do not grow in culture. We have 
      developed a genetic rescue strategy that combines CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout with 
      TALEN-mediated integration of a doxycycline-inducible rescue transgene into a 
      constitutive AASV1 locus. The resulting rescue clones are stable in culture, allow 
      modulation of the rescue transgene dosage by titration of doxycycline in the media 
      and can be combined with various molecular assays, thus providing mechanistic 
      insights into gene function in a variety of cellular contexts.

TI  - RAB18 Loss Interferes With Lipid Droplet Catabolism and Provokes Autophagy Network 
      Adaptations.

AB  - Autophagy is dependent on appropriate lipid supply for autophagosome formation. The 
      regulation of lipid acquisition and the autophagy network response to lipid-limiting 
      conditions are mostly elusive. Here, we show that the knockout of the RAB GTPase 
      RAB18 interferes with lipid droplet catabolism, causing an impaired fatty acid 
      release. The resulting reduced lipid-droplet-derived lipid availability influences 
      autophagy and provokes adaptive modifications of the autophagy network. These 
      adjustments include increased expression and phosphorylation of ATG2B as well as 
      augmented formation of the ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. Moreover, ATG9A shows an enhanced 
      phosphorylation at amino acid residues tyrosine 8 and serine 14, resulting in an 
      increased ATG9A trafficking. Via pharmacological inhibition of Y8 phosphorylation, 
      we demonstrate that this ATG9A modification is important to maintain basal autophagy 
      under RAB18 knockout conditions. However, while the network adaptations are 
      sufficient to maintain basal autophagic activity, they are incapable of ensuring 
      autophagy induction upon starvation, which is characterized by an enhanced lipid 
      demand. Thus, here, we define the molecular role of RAB18 in connecting lipid 
      droplets and autophagy, emphasize the significance of lipid droplets as lipid 
      sources for the degradative pathway, and uncover a remarkable autophagy network 
      plasticity, including phosphorylation-dependent ATG9A activation, to compensate 
      reduced lipid availability in order to rescue basal autophagic activity.

TI  - MAFB modulates the maturation of lymphatic vascular networks in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic vessels play key roles in tissue fluid homeostasis, immune 
      cell trafficking and in diverse disease settings. Lymphangiogenesis requires 
      lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) differentiation, proliferation, migration, and 
      co-ordinated network formation, yet the transcriptional regulators underpinning 
      these processes remain to be fully understood. The transcription factor MAFB was 
      recently identified as essential for lymphangiogenesis in zebrafish and in cultured 
      human LECs. MAFB is activated in response to VEGFC-VEGFR3 signaling and acts as a 
      downstream effector. However, it remains unclear if the role of MAFB in lymphatic 
      development is conserved in the mammalian embryo. RESULTS: We generated a Mafb 
      loss-of-function mouse using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Mafb mutant mice presented 
      with perinatal lethality associated with cyanosis. We identify a role for MAFB in 
      modifying lymphatic network morphogenesis in the developing dermis, as well as 
      developing and postnatal diaphragm. Furthermore, mutant vessels displayed excessive 
      smooth muscle cell coverage, suggestive of a defect in the maturation of lymphatic 
      networks. CONCLUSIONS: This work confirms a conserved role for MAFB in murine 
      lymphatics that is subtle and modulatory and may suggest redundancy in MAF family 
      transcription factors during lymphangiogenesis.

AB  - Cyclic di- and linear oligo-nucleotide signals activate defenses against invasive 
      nucleic acids in animal immunity; however, their evolutionary antecedents are poorly 
      understood. Using comparative genomics, sequence and structure analysis, we 
      uncovered a vast network of systems defined by conserved prokaryotic 
      gene-neighborhoods, which encode enzymes generating such nucleotides or 
      alternatively processing them to yield potential signaling molecules. The 
      nucleotide-generating enzymes include several clades of the DNA-polymerase β-like 
      superfamily (including Vibrio cholerae DncV), a minimal version of the CRISPR 
      polymerase and DisA-like cyclic-di-AMP synthetases. Nucleotide-binding/processing 
      domains include TIR domains and members of a superfamily prototyped by Smf/DprA 
      proteins and base (cytokinin)-releasing LOG enzymes. They are combined in conserved 
      gene-neighborhoods with genes for a plethora of protein superfamilies, which we 
      predict to function as nucleotide-sensors and effectors targeting nucleic acids, 
      proteins or membranes (pore-forming agents). These systems are sometimes combined 
      with other biological conflict-systems such as restriction-modification and 
      CRISPR/Cas. Interestingly, several are coupled in mutually exclusive neighborhoods 
      with either a prokaryotic ubiquitin-system or a HORMA domain-PCH2-like AAA+ ATPase 
      dyad. The latter are potential precursors of equivalent proteins in eukaryotic 
      chromosome dynamics. Further, components from these nucleotide-centric systems have 
      been utilized in several other systems including a novel diversity-generating system 
      with a reverse transcriptase. We also found the Smf/DprA/LOG domain from these 
      systems to be recruited as a predicted nucleotide-binding domain in eukaryotic TRPM 
      channels. These findings point to evolutionary and mechanistic links, which bring 
      together CRISPR/Cas, animal interferon-induced immunity, and several other systems 
      that combine nucleic-acid-sensing and nucleotide-dependent signaling.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a versatile microbial platform to build synthetic 
      metabolic pathways for production of diverse chemicals. To expedite the construction 
      of complex metabolic pathways by multiplex CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edit, eight desirable 
      intergenic loci, located adjacent to highly expressed genes selected from top 100 
      expressers, were identified and fully characterized for three criteria after 
      integrating green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene - CRISPR-mediated GFP integration 
      efficiency, expression competency assessed by levels of GFP fluorescence, and 
      assessing growth rates of GFP integrated strains. Five best performing intergenic 
      loci were selected to build a multiplex CRISPR platform, and a synthetic 23-bp DNA 
      comprised of 20-bp synthetic DNA with a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) was 
      integrated into the five loci using CRISPR-Cas9 in a sequential manner. This process 
      resulted in five different yeast strains harbouring 1-5 synthetic gRNA-binding sites 
      in their genomes. Using these pre-engineered yeast strains, simultaneous 
      integrations of 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-genes to the targeted loci were demonstrated with 
      efficiencies from 85% to 98% using beet pigment betalain (3-gene pathway), 
      hygromycin and geneticin resistance markers. Integrations of the multiple, foreign 
      genes in the targeted loci with 100% precision were validated by genotyping. 
      Finally, we further developed the strain to have 6th synthetic gRNA-binding site, 
      and the resulting yeast strain was used to generate a yeast strain producing a 
      sesquiterpene lactone, kauniolide by simultaneous 6-gene integrations. This study 
      demonstrates the effectiveness of a single gRNA-mediated CRISPR platform to build 
      complex metabolic pathways in yeast.

AB  - The faithful execution of cell division requires the coordinated action of hundreds 
      of gene products. Precisely perturbing these gene products in cells is central to 
      understanding their functions during normal cell division, and the contributions of 
      their disruption to disease. Here, we describe experimental approaches for using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 for gene disruption and modification, with a focus on human cell 
      culture. We describe strategies for inducible gene disruption to generate acute 
      knockouts of essential cell division genes, which can be modified for the chronic 
      elimination of nonessential genes. We also describe strategies for modifying the 
      genome to generate protein fusions to report on and modify protein behavior. These 
      tools facilitate investigation of protein function, dissection of protein assembly 
      networks, and analyses of disease-associated mutations.

      repeats of the transcriptional activator VP16 (VP64) could be used for 
      transcriptional activation of endogenous genes in plants. In this study, we 
      developed a second generation of vector systems for enhanced transcriptional 
      activation in plants. We tested multiple strategies for dCas9-based transcriptional 
      activation, and found that simultaneous recruitment of VP64 by dCas9 and a modified 
      guide RNA scaffold gRNA2.0 (designated CRISPR-Act2.0) yielded stronger 
      transcriptional activation than the dCas9-VP64 system. Moreover, we developed a 
      multiplex transcription activator-like effector activation (mTALE-Act) system for 
      simultaneous activation of up to four genes in plants. Our results suggest that 
      mTALE-Act is even more effective than CRISPR-Act2.0 in most cases tested. In 
      addition, we explored tissue-specific gene activation using positive feedback loops. 
      Interestingly, our study revealed that certain endogenous genes are more amenable 
      than others to transcriptional activation, and tightly regulated genes may cause 
      target gene silencing when perturbed by activation probes. Hence, these new tools 
      could be used to investigate gene regulatory networks and their control mechanisms. 
      Assembly of multiplex CRISPR-Act2.0 and mTALE-Act systems are both based on 
      streamlined and PCR-independent Golden Gate and Gateway cloning strategies, which 
      will facilitate transcriptional activation applications in both dicots and monocots.

TI  - sgRNACNN: identifying sgRNA on-target activity in four crops using ensembles of 
      convolutional neural networks.

AB  - We proposed an ensemble convolutional neural network model to identify sgRNA high 
      on-target activity in four crops and we used one-hot encoding and k-mers for 
      sequence encoding. As an important component of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, single-guide 
      RNA (sgRNA) plays an important role in gene redirection and editing. sgRNA has 
      played an important role in the improvement of agronomic species, but there is a 
      lack of effective bioinformatics tools to identify the activity of sgRNA in 
      agronomic species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method based on machine 
      learning to identify sgRNA high on-target activity. In this work, we proposed a 
      simple convolutional neural network method to identify sgRNA high on-target 
      activity. Our study used one-hot encoding and k-mers for sequence data conversion 
      and a voting algorithm for constructing the convolutional neural network ensemble 
      model sgRNACNN for the prediction of sgRNA activity. The ensemble model sgRNACNN was 
      used for predictions in four crops: Glycine max, Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and 
      Triticum aestivum. The accuracy rates of the four crops in the sgRNACNN model were 
      82.43%, 80.33%, 78.25% and 87.49%, respectively. The experimental results showed 
      that sgRNACNN realizes the identification of high on-target activity sgRNA of 
      agronomic data and can meet the demands of sgRNA activity prediction in agronomy to 
      a certain extent. These results have certain significance for guiding crop gene 
      editing and academic research. The source code and relevant dataset can be found in

TI  - Genome-Resolved Metagenomics Extends the Environmental Distribution of the 
      Verrucomicrobia Phylum to the Deep Terrestrial Subsurface.
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00613-19 [doi]
LID - e00613-19
AB  - Bacteria of the phylum Verrucomicrobia are prevalent and are particularly common in 
      soil and freshwater environments. Their cosmopolitan distribution and reported 
      capacity for polysaccharide degradation suggests members of Verrucomicrobia are 
      important contributors to carbon cycling across Earth's ecosystems. Despite their 
      prevalence, the Verrucomicrobia are underrepresented in isolate collections and 
      genome databases; consequently, their ecophysiological roles may not be fully 
      realized. Here, we expand genomic sampling of the Verrucomicrobia phylum by 
      describing a novel genus, "Candidatus Marcellius," belonging to the order Opitutales 
      "Ca. Marcellius" was recovered from a shale-derived produced fluid metagenome 
      collected 313 days after hydraulic fracturing, the deepest environment from which a 
      member of the Verrucomicrobia has been recovered to date. We uncover genomic 
      attributes that may explain the capacity of this organism to inhabit a shale gas 
      well, including the potential for utilization of organic polymers common in 
      hydraulic fracturing fluids, nitrogen fixation, adaptation to high salinities, and 
      adaptive immunity via CRISPR-Cas. To illuminate the phylogenetic and environmental 
      distribution of these metabolic and adaptive traits across the Verrucomicrobia 
      phylum, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 31 publicly available, nearly 
      complete Verrucomicrobia genomes. Our genomic findings extend the environmental 
      distribution of the Verrucomicrobia 2.3 kilometers into the terrestrial subsurface. 
      Moreover, we reveal traits widely encoded across members of the Verrucomicrobia, 
      including the capacity to degrade hemicellulose and to adapt to physical and 
      biological environmental perturbations, thereby contributing to the expansive 
      habitat range reported for this phylum.IMPORTANCE The Verrucomicrobia phylum of 
      bacteria is widespread in many different ecosystems; however, its role in microbial 
      communities remains poorly understood. Verrucomicrobia are often low-abundance 
      community members, yet previous research suggests they play a major role in organic 
      carbon degradation. While Verrucomicrobia remain poorly represented in culture 
      collections, numerous genomes have been reconstructed from metagenomic data sets in 
      recent years. The study of genomes from across the phylum allows for an extensive 
      assessment of their potential ecosystem roles. The significance of this work is (i) 
      the recovery of a novel genus of Verrucomicrobia from 2.3 km in the subsurface with 
      the ability to withstand the extreme conditions that characterize this environment, 
      and (ii) the most extensive assessment of ecophysiological traits encoded by 
      Verrucomicrobia genomes to date. We show that members of this phylum are specialist 
      organic polymer degraders that can withstand a wider range of environmental 
      conditions than previously thought.

LID - 15459
AB  - Natural genetic circuits enable cells to make sophisticated digital decisions. 
      Building equally complex synthetic circuits in eukaryotes remains difficult, 
      however, because commonly used components leak transcriptionally, do not arbitrarily 
      interconnect or do not have digital responses. Here, we designed dCas9-Mxi1-based 
      NOR gates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allow arbitrary connectivity and large 
      genetic circuits. Because we used the chromatin remodeller Mxi1, our gates showed 
      minimal leak and digital responses. We built a combinatorial library of NOR gates 
      that directly convert guide RNA (gRNA) inputs into gRNA outputs, enabling the gates 
      to be 'wired' together. We constructed logic circuits with up to seven gRNAs, 
      including repression cascades with up to seven layers. Modelling predicted the NOR 
      gates have effectively zero transcriptional leak explaining the limited signal 
      degradation in the circuits. Our approach enabled the largest, eukaryotic gene 
      circuits to date and will form the basis for large, synthetic, cellular 
      decision-making systems.

TI  - Molecular Titration Promotes Oscillations and Bistability in Minimal Network Models 
      with Monomeric Regulators.
PG  - 321-33
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.5b00176 [doi]
AB  - Molecular titration is emerging as an important biochemical interaction mechanism 
      within synthetic devices built with nucleic acids and the CRISPR/Cas system. We show 
      that molecular titration in the context of feedback circuits is a suitable mechanism 
      to enhance the emergence of oscillations and bistable behaviors. We consider 
      biomolecular modules that can be inhibited or activated by input monomeric 
      regulators; the regulators compete with constitutive titrating species to determine 
      the activity of their target. By tuning the titration rate and the concentration of 
      titrating species, it is possible to modulate the delay and convergence speed of the 
      transient response, and the steepness and dead zone of the stationary response of 
      the modules. These phenomena favor the occurrence of oscillations when modules are 
      interconnected to create a negative feedback loop; bistability is favored in a 
      positive feedback interconnection. Numerical simulations are supported by 
      mathematical analysis showing that the capacity of the closed loop systems to 
      exhibit oscillations or bistability is structural.

AB  - Developmental genes are often regulated by multiple elements with overlapping 
      activity. Yet, in most cases, the relative function of those elements and their 
      contribution to endogenous gene expression remain poorly characterized. An example 
      of this phenomenon is that distinct sets of enhancers have been proposed to direct 
      Fgf8 in the limb apical ectodermal ridge and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. Using 
      in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering, we functionally dissect this complex 
      regulatory ensemble and demonstrate two distinct regulatory logics. In the apical 
      ectodermal ridge, the control of Fgf8 expression appears distributed between 
      different enhancers. In contrast, we find that in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, 
      one of the three active enhancers is essential while the other two are dispensable. 
      We further dissect the essential midbrain-hindbrain boundary enhancer to reveal that 
      it is also composed by a mixture of essential and dispensable modules. Cross-species 
      transgenic analysis of this enhancer suggests that its composition may have changed 
      in the vertebrate lineage.

TI  - Efficient deletion of multiple circle RNA loci by CRISPR-Cas9 reveals Os06circ02797 
      as a putative sponge for OsMIR408 in rice.
PG  - 1240-1252
LID - 10.1111/pbi.13544 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 is an emerging genome editing tool for reverse genetics in plants. 
      However, its application for functional study of non-coding RNAs in plants is still 
      at its infancy. Despite being a major class of non-coding RNAs, the biological roles 
      of circle RNAs (circRNAs) remain largely unknown in plants. Previous plant circRNA 
      studies have focused on identification and annotation of putative circRNAs, with 
      their functions largely uninvestigated by genetic approaches. Here, we applied a 
      multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9 strategy to efficiently acquire individual null mutants for 
      four circRNAs in rice. We showed each of these rice circRNA loci (Os02circ25329, 
      Os06circ02797, Os03circ00204 and Os05circ02465) can be deleted at 10% or higher 
      efficiency in both protoplasts and stable transgenic T0 lines. Such high efficiency 
      deletion enabled the generation of circRNA null allele plants without the 
      CRISPR-Cas9 transgene in the T1 generation. Characterization of the mutants reveals 
      these circRNAs' participation in salt stress response during seed germination and in 
      particular the Os05circ02465 null mutant showed high salt tolerance. Notably, the 
      seedlings of the Os06circ02797 mutant showed rapid growth phenotype after seed 
      germination with the seedlings containing higher chlorophyll A/B content. Further 
      molecular and computational analyses suggested a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory 
      network where Os06circ02797 functions to bind and sequester OsMIR408, an important 
      and conserved microRNA in plants. This study not only presents genetic evidence for 
      the first time in plants that certain circRNAs may serve as sponges to negatively 
      regulate miRNAs, a phenomenon previously demonstrated in mammalian cells, but also 
      provides important insights for improving agronomic traits through gene editing of 
      circRNA loci in crops.

AB  - Streptococcus thermophilus is a lactic acid bacterium widely used in the syntrophic 
      fermentation of milk into yogurt and cheese. Streptococcus thermophilus has adapted 
      to ferment milk primarily through reductive genome evolution but also through 
      acquisition of genes conferring proto-cooperation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and 
      efficient metabolism of milk macronutrients. Genomic analysis of Strep. thermophilus 
      strains suggests that mobile genetic elements have contributed to genomic evolution 
      through horizontal gene transfer and genomic plasticity. We previously used the 
      endogenous type II CRISPR-Cas [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated sequences (Cas)] system in Strep. 
      thermophilus to isolate derivatives lacking the chromosomal mobile genetic element 
      and expandable island that display decreased fitness under routine culturing 
      conditions. Of note, the Lac operon and Leloir pathway genes were deleted in the 
      largest expendable genomic island (102 kbp), rendering the strain incapable of 
      acidifying milk. However, the removal of other open reading frames in the same 
      island had unclear effects on the fitness and regulatory networks of Strep. 
      thermophilus. To uncover the physiological basis for the observed phenotypic changes 
      and underlying regulatory networks affected by deletion of the 102-kbp genomic 
      island in Strep. thermophilus, we analyzed the transcriptome of the mutant that 
      lacked ∼5% of its genome. In addition to the loss of transcripts encoded by the 
      deleted material, we detected a total of 56 genes that were differentially 
      expressed, primarily encompassing 10 select operons. Several predicted metabolic 
      pathways were affected, including amino acid and purine metabolism, oligopeptide 
      transport, and iron transport. Collectively, these results suggest that deletion of 
      a 102-kb genomic island in Strep. thermophilus influences compensatory transcription 
      of starvation stress response genes and metabolic pathways involved in important 
      niche-related adaptation.

LID - 10.1534/genetics.119.302089 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-mediated base editors have opened unique avenues for scar-free genome-wide 
      mutagenesis. Here, we describe a comprehensive computational workflow called beditor 
      that can be broadly adapted for designing guide RNA libraries with a range of 
      CRISPR-mediated base editors, Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) recognition 
      sequences, and genomes of many species. Additionally, to assist users in selecting 
      the best sets of guide RNAs for their experiments, a priori estimates of editing 
      efficiency, called beditor scores, are calculated. These beditor scores are intended 
      to select guide RNAs that conform to requirements for optimal base editing: the 
      editable base falls within maximum activity window of the CRISPR-mediated base 
      editor and produces nonconfounding mutational effects with minimal predicted 
      off-target effects. We demonstrate the utility of the software by designing guide 
      RNAs for base editing to model or correct thousands of clinically important human 
      disease mutations.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to measure the attitudes of Indonesian medical doctors and 
      students toward new technology in genome editing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online 
      questionnaires regarding attitudes toward genome editing on health and non-health 
      conditions, both in somatic cells and embryo, were distributed through researcher 
      networks, email and social media specific to medical doctors and students. The data 
      of 1055 valid questionnaires were processed; descriptive and association analyses 
      between sociodemographic factors and attitudes toward genome editing were performed. 
      Email in-depth interview was performed to explore the respondents' answers. RESULTS: 
      The results showed that Indonesian medical doctors' and students' knowledge of 
      genome editing was limited and correlated with gender, place of residence, religion, 
      education, marital status, childbearing and experience abroad. More than half of 
      respondents supported genome editing for the treatment of fatal and debilitating 
      diseases both in somatic cells and embryos, implying their consent to edited gene 
      inheritance. However, this approval decreased when applied to non-health-related 
      aspects, such as physical appearance, intelligence and strength. Factors affecting 
      their attitudes toward genome editing included their status as medical doctors or 
      students, gender, age, education, religion, economic status and place of residence. 
      CONCLUSION: Increasing knowledge and awareness of Indonesian medical doctors and 
      students regarding genome editing is important. Even though its application in 
      health-related matter was supported by a majority of the respondents, discussion 
      from ethical and religious perspectives is necessary to ensure the acceptance.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 Guided Mutagenesis of Grain Size 3 Confers Increased Rice (Oryza sativa 
      L.) Grain Length by Regulating Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitor and Ubiquitin-Related 
      Proteins.

AB  - Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 
      protein (Cas9)-mediated genome editing has become an important way for molecular 
      breeding in crop plants. To promote rice breeding, we edited the Grain Size 3 (GS3) 
      gene for obtaining valuable and stable long-grain rice mutants. Furthermore, 
      isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic 
      method were applied to determine the proteome-wide changes in the GS3 mutants 
      compared with wild type (WT). Two target sites were designed to construct the 
      vector, and the Agrobacterium-mediated method was used for rice transformation. 
      Specific mutations were successfully introduced, and the grain length (GL) and 
      1000-grain weight (GWT) of the mutants were increased by 31.39% and 27.15%, 
      respectively, compared with WT. The iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis revealed that a 
      total of 31 proteins were differentially expressed in the GS3 mutants, including 20 
      up-regulated and 11 down-regulated proteins. Results showed that differentially 
      expressed proteins (DEPs) were mainly related to cysteine synthase, cysteine 
      proteinase inhibitor, vacuolar protein sorting-associated, ubiquitin, and DNA 
      ligase. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that DEPs were mostly enriched in 
      cellular process, metabolic process, binding, transmembrane, structural, and 
      catalytic activities. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEPs were mainly 
      involved in lipid metabolism and oxylipin biosynthesis. The protein-to-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network found that proteins related to DNA damage-binding, 
      ubiquitin-40S ribosomal, and cysteine proteinase inhibitor showed a higher degree of 
      interaction. The homozygous mutant lines featured by stable inheritance and 
      long-grain phenotype were obtained using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This study provides 
      a convenient and effective way of improving grain yield, which could significantly 
      accelerate the breeding process of long-grain japonica parents and promote the 
      development of high-yielding rice.

TI  - A large-scale CRISPR screen and identification of essential genes in cellular 
      senescence bypass.
PG  - 4011-4031
LID - 10.18632/aging.102034 [doi]
AB  - Cellular senescence is an important mechanism of autonomous tumor suppression, while 
      its consequence such as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) may 
      drive tumorigenesis and age-related diseases. Therefore, controlling the cell fate 
      optimally when encountering senescence stress is helpful for anti-cancer or 
      anti-aging treatments. To identify genes essential for senescence establishment or 
      maintenance, we carried out a CRISPR-based screen with a deliberately designed 
      single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library. The library comprised of about 12,000 kinds of 
      sgRNAs targeting 1378 senescence-associated genes selected by integrating the 
      information of literature mining, protein-protein interaction network, and 
      differential gene expression. We successfully detected a dozen gene deficiencies 
      potentially causing senescence bypass, and their phenotypes were further validated 
      with a high true positive rate. RNA-seq analysis showed distinct transcriptome 
      patterns of these bypass cells. Interestingly, in the bypass cells, the expression 
      of SASP genes was maintained or elevated with CHEK2, HAS1, or MDK deficiency; but 
      neutralized with MTOR, CRISPLD2, or MORF4L1 deficiency. Pathways of some age-related 
      neurodegenerative disorders were also downregulated with MTOR, CRISPLD2, or MORF4L1 
      deficiency. The results demonstrated that disturbing these genes could lead to 
      distinct cell fates as a consequence of senescence bypass, suggesting that they may 
      play essential roles in cellular senescence.

TI  - Mic13 Is Essential for Formation of Crista Junctions in Mammalian Cells.
PG  - e0160258
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0160258 [doi]
LID - e0160258
AB  - Mitochondrial cristae are connected to the inner boundary membrane via crista 
      junctions which are implicated in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, 
      apoptosis, and import of lipids and proteins. The MICOS complex determines formation 
      of crista junctions. We performed complexome profiling and identified Mic13, also 
      termed Qil1, as a subunit of the MICOS complex. We show that MIC13 is an inner 
      membrane protein physically interacting with MIC60, a central subunit of the MICOS 
      complex. Using the CRISPR/Cas method we generated the first cell line deleted for 
      MIC13. These knockout cells show a complete loss of crista junctions demonstrating 
      that MIC13 is strictly required for the formation of crista junctions. MIC13 is 
      required for the assembly of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 into the MICOS complex. 
      However, it is not needed for the formation of the MIC60/MIC19/MIC25 subcomplex 
      suggesting that the latter is not sufficient for crista junction formation. MIC13 is 
      also dispensable for assembly of respiratory chain complexes and for maintaining 
      mitochondrial network morphology. Still, lack of MIC13 resulted in a moderate 
      reduction of mitochondrial respiration. In summary, we show that MIC13 has a 
      fundamental role in crista junction formation and that assembly of respiratory chain 
      supercomplexes is independent of mitochondrial cristae shape.

TI  - A common molecular logic determines embryonic stem cell self-renewal and 
      reprogramming.
LID - 10.15252/embj.2018100003 [doi]
LID - e100003
AB  - During differentiation and reprogramming, new cell identities are generated by 
      reconfiguration of gene regulatory networks. Here, we combined automated formal 
      reasoning with experimentation to expose the logic of network activation during 
      induction of naïve pluripotency. We find that a Boolean network architecture defined 
      for maintenance of naïve state embryonic stem cells (ESC) also explains 
      transcription factor behaviour and potency during resetting from primed 
      pluripotency. Computationally identified gene activation trajectories were 
      experimentally substantiated at single-cell resolution by RT-qPCR Contingency of 
      factor availability explains the counterintuitive observation that Klf2, which is 
      dispensable for ESC maintenance, is required during resetting. We tested 124 
      predictions formulated by the dynamic network, finding a predictive accuracy of 
      77.4%. Finally, we show that this network explains and predicts experimental 
      observations of somatic cell reprogramming. We conclude that a common deterministic 
      program of gene regulation is sufficient to govern maintenance and induction of 
      naïve pluripotency. The tools exemplified here could be broadly applied to delineate 
      dynamic networks underlying cell fate transitions.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-Assisted Seamless Genome Editing in Lactobacillus plantarum and Its 
      Application in N-Acetylglucosamine Production.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum is a potential starter and health-promoting probiotic 
      bacterium. Effective, precise, and diverse genome editing of Lactobacillus plantarum 
      without introducing exogenous genes or plasmids is of great importance. In this 
      study, CRISPR/Cas9-assisted double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA 
      (ssDNA) recombineering was established in L. plantarum WCFS1 to seamlessly edit the 
      genome, including gene knockouts, insertions, and point mutations. To optimize our 
      editing method, phosphorothioate modification was used to improve the dsDNA 
      insertion, and adenine-specific methyltransferase was used to improve the ssDNA 
      recombination efficiency. These strategies were applied to engineer L. plantarum 
      WCFS1 toward producing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). nagB was truncated to eliminate 
      the reverse reaction of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to glucosamine 6-phosphate 
      (GlcN-6P). Riboswitch replacement and point mutation in glmS1 were introduced to 
      relieve feedback repression. The resulting strain produced 797.3 mg/liter GlcNAc 
      without introducing exogenous genes or plasmids. This strategy may contribute to the 
      available methods for precise and diverse genetic engineering in lactic acid 
      bacteria and boost strain engineering for more applications.IMPORTANCE 
      CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering is restricted in lactic acid bacteria because of 
      the lack of available antibiotics and vectors. In this study, a seamless genome 
      editing method was carried out in Lactobacillus plantarum using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted 
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) recombineering, and 
      recombination efficiency was effectively improved by endogenous adenine-specific 
      methyltransferase overexpression. L. plantarum WCFS1 produced 797.3 mg/liter 
      N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) through reinforcement of the GlcNAc pathway, without 
      introducing exogenous genes or plasmids. This seamless editing strategy, combined 
      with the potential exogenous GlcNAc-producing pathway, makes this strain an 
      attractive candidate for industrial use in the future.

AB  - Low success rates during drug development are due, in part, to the difficulty of 
      defining drug mechanism-of-action and molecular markers of therapeutic activity. 
      Here, we integrated 199,219 drug sensitivity measurements for 397 unique anti-cancer 
      drugs with genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screens in 484 cell lines to 
      systematically investigate cellular drug mechanism-of-action. We observed an 
      enrichment for positive associations between the profile of drug sensitivity and 
      knockout of a drug's nominal target, and by leveraging protein-protein networks, we 
      identified pathways underpinning drug sensitivity. This revealed an unappreciated 
      positive association between mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCH5 
      dependency and sensitivity to MCL1 inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines. We also 
      estimated drug on-target and off-target activity, informing on specificity, potency 
      and toxicity. Linking drug and gene dependency together with genomic data sets 
      uncovered contexts in which molecular networks when perturbed mediate cancer cell 
      loss-of-fitness and thereby provide independent and orthogonal evidence of 
      biomarkers for drug development. This study illustrates how integrating cell line 
      drug sensitivity with CRISPR loss-of-function screens can elucidate 
      mechanism-of-action to advance drug development.

AB  - An emerging theme from large-scale genetic screens that identify genes essential for 
      cell fitness is that essentiality of a given gene is highly context-specific. 
      Identification of such contexts could be the key to defining gene function and also 
      to develop novel therapeutic interventions. Here, we present Context-specific 
      Essentiality Network-tools (CEN-tools), a website and python package, in which users 
      can interrogate the essentiality of a gene from large-scale genome-scale CRISPR 
      screens in a number of biological contexts including tissue of origin, mutation 
      profiles, expression levels and drug responses. We show that CEN-tools is suitable 
      for the systematic identification of genetic dependencies and for more targeted 
      queries. The associations between genes and a given context are represented as 
      dependency networks (CENs), and we demonstrate the utility of these networks in 
      elucidating novel gene functions. In addition, we integrate the dependency networks 
      with existing protein-protein interaction networks to reveal context-dependent 
      essential cellular pathways in cancer cells. Together, we demonstrate the 
      applicability of CEN-tools in aiding the current efforts to define the human 
      cellular dependency map.

AB  - Self-renewal and pluripotency of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) state are established 
      and maintained by multiple regulatory networks that comprise transcription factors 
      and epigenetic regulators. While much has been learned regarding transcription 
      factors, the function of epigenetic regulators in these networks is less well 
      defined. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function genetic screen that 
      identified two epigenetic regulators, TAF5L and TAF6L, components or co-activators 
      of the GNAT-HAT complexes for the mouse ESC (mESC) state. Detailed molecular studies 
      demonstrate that TAF5L/TAF6L transcriptionally activate c-Myc and Oct4 and their 
      corresponding MYC and CORE regulatory networks. Besides, TAF5L/TAF6L predominantly 
      regulate their target genes through H3K9ac deposition and c-MYC recruitment that 
      eventually activate the MYC regulatory network for self-renewal of mESCs. Thus, our 
      findings uncover a role of TAF5L/TAF6L in directing the MYC regulatory network that 
      orchestrates gene expression programs to control self-renewal for the maintenance 
      of mESC state.

AB  - To realize the promise of CRISPR-Cas9-based genetics, approaches are needed to 
      quantify a specific, molecular phenotype across genome-wide libraries of genetic 
      perturbations. We addressed this challenge by profiling transcriptional, 
      translational, and posttranslational reporters using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) 
      with barcoded expression reporter sequencing (CiBER-seq). Our barcoding approach 
      allowed us to connect an entire library of guides to their individual phenotypic 
      consequences using pooled sequencing. CiBER-seq profiling fully recapitulated the 
      integrated stress response (ISR) pathway in yeast. Genetic perturbations causing 
      uncharged transfer RNA (tRNA) accumulation activated ISR reporter transcription. 
      Notably, tRNA insufficiency also activated the reporter, independent of the 
      uncharged tRNA sensor. By uncovering alternate triggers for ISR activation, we 
      illustrate how precise, comprehensive CiBER-seq profiling provides a powerful and 
      broadly applicable tool for dissecting genetic networks.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 editing of wheat TaQ genes alters spike morphogenesis and grain 
      threshability.

AB  - The TaQ alleles as one of the AP2-like transcription factors in common wheat 
      (Triticum aestivum) play an important role in the evolution of spike characteristics 
      from wild and domesticated emmer to modern wheat cultivars. Its loss-of-function 
      mutant not only changed threshability and spike architecture but also affected plant 
      height, flowering time, and floret structure. However, the comprehensive functions 
      of TaAQ and TaDq genes in wheat have not been fully elucidated yet. Here, 
      CRISPR/SpCas9 was used to edit wheat TaAQ and TaDq. We obtained homozygous plants in 
      the T(1) generation with loss of function of only TaAQ or TaDq and simultaneous loss 
      of function of TaAQ and TaDq to analyze the effect of these genes on wheat spikes 
      and floret shapes. The results demonstrated that the TaAQ-edited plants and the TaAQ 
      and TaDq simultaneously-edited plants were nearly similar in spike architecture, 
      whereas the TaDq-edited plants were different from the wild-type ones only in plant 
      height. Moreover, the TaAQ-edited plants or the TaAQ and TaDq simultaneously-edited 
      plants were more brittle than the wild-type and the TaDq-edited plants. Based on the 
      expression profiling, we postulated that the VRN1, FUL2, SEP2, SEP5, and SEP6 genes 
      might affect the number of spikelets and florets per spike in wheat by regulating 
      the expression of TaQ. Combining the results of this report and previous reports, we 
      conceived a regulatory network of wheat traits, including plant height, spike shape, 
      and floral organs, which were influenced by AP2-like family genes. The results 
      achieved in this study will help us to understand the regulating mechanisms of TaAQ 
      and TaDq alleles on wheat floral organs and inflorescence development.

TI  - Ash2l interacts with Oct4-stemness circuitry to promote super-enhancer-driven 
      pluripotency network.
PG  - 10115-10133
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkz801 [doi]
AB  - Pluripotency and cell fates can be modulated through the regulation of 
      super-enhancers; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we showed a 
      novel mechanism in which Ash2l directly binds to super-enhancers of several stemness 
      genes to regulate pluripotency and self-renewal in pluripotent stem cells. Ash2l 
      recruits Oct4/Sox2/Nanog (OSN) to form Ash2l/OSN complex at the super-enhancers of 
      Jarid2, Nanog, Sox2 and Oct4, and further drives enhancer activation, upregulation 
      of stemness genes, and maintains the pluripotent circuitry. Ash2l knockdown 
      abrogates the OSN recruitment to all super-enhancers and further hinders the 
      enhancer activation. In addition, CRISPRi/dCas9-mediated blocking of Ash2l-binding 
      motifs at these super-enhancers also prevents OSN recruitment and enhancer 
      activation, validating that Ash2l directly binds to super-enhancers and initiates 
      the pluripotency network. Transfection of Ash2l with W118A mutation to disrupt 
      Ash2l-Oct4 interaction fails to rescue Ash2l-driven enhancer activation and 
      pluripotent gene upregulation in Ash2l-depleted pluripotent stem cells. Together, 
      our data demonstrated Ash2l formed an enhancer-bound Ash2l/OSN complex that can 
      drive enhancer activation, govern pluripotency network and stemness circuitry.

TI  - Trans-splicing enhances translational efficiency in C. elegans.

AB  - Translational efficiency is subject to extensive regulation. However, the factors 
      influencing such regulation are poorly understood. In Caenorhabditis elegans, 62% of 
      genes are trans-spliced to a specific spliced leader (SL1), which replaces part of 
      the native 5' untranslated region (5' UTR). Given the pivotal role the 5' UTR plays 
      in the regulation of translational efficiency, we hypothesized that SL1 
      trans-splicing functions to regulate translational efficiency. With genome-wide 
      analysis on Ribo-seq data, polysome profiling experiments, and CRISPR-Cas9-based 
      genetic manipulation of trans-splicing sites, we found four lines of evidence in 
      support of this hypothesis. First, SL1 trans-spliced genes have higher translational 
      efficiencies than non-trans-spliced genes. Second, SL1 trans-spliced genes have 
      higher translational efficiencies than non-trans-spliced orthologous genes in other 
      nematode species. Third, an SL1 trans-spliced isoform has higher translational 
      efficiency than the non-trans-spliced isoform of the same gene. Fourth, deletion of 
      trans-splicing sites of endogenous genes leads to reduced translational efficiency. 
      Importantly, we demonstrated that SL1 trans-splicing plays a key role in enhancing 
      translational efficiencies of essential genes. We further discovered that SL1 
      trans-splicing likely enhances translational efficiency by shortening the native 5' 
      UTRs, hence reducing the presence of upstream start codons (uAUG) and weakening mRNA 
      secondary structures. Taken together, our study elucidates the global function of 
      trans-splicing in enhancing translational efficiency in nematodes, paving the way 
      for further understanding the genomic mechanisms of translational regulation.

AB  - Bacterial biofilm formation involves signaling and regulatory pathways that control 
      the transition from motile to sessile lifestyle, production of extracellular 
      polymeric matrix, and maturation of the biofilm 3D structure. Biofilms are 
      extensively studied because of their importance in biomedical, ecological and 
      industrial settings. Gene inactivation is a powerful approach for functional studies 
      but it is often labor intensive, limiting systematic gene surveys to the most 
      tractable bacterial hosts. Here, we adapted the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system 
      for use in diverse strain isolates of P. fluorescens, SBW25, WH6 and Pf0-1. We found 
      that CRISPRi is applicable to study complex phenotypes such as cell morphology, 
      motility and biofilm formation over extended periods of time. In SBW25, 
      CRISPRi-mediated silencing of genes encoding the GacA/S two-component system and 
      regulatory proteins associated with the cylic di-GMP signaling messenger produced 
      swarming and biofilm phenotypes similar to those obtained after gene inactivation. 
      Combined with detailed confocal microscopy of biofilms, our study also revealed 
      novel phenotypes associated with extracellular matrix biosynthesis as well as the 
      potent inhibition of SBW25 biofilm formation mediated by the PFLU1114 operon. We 
      conclude that CRISPRi is a reliable and scalable approach to investigate gene 
      networks in the diverse P. fluorescens group.

AB  - The metabolic pathways fueling tumor growth have been well characterized, but the 
      specific impact of transforming events on network topology and enzyme essentiality 
      remains poorly understood. To this end, we performed combinatorial CRISPR-Cas9 
      screens on a set of 51 carbohydrate metabolism genes that represent glycolysis and 
      the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This high-throughput methodology enabled 
      systems-level interrogation of metabolic gene dispensability, interactions, and 
      compensation across multiple cell types. The metabolic impact of specific 
      combinatorial knockouts was validated using (13)C and (2)H isotope tracing, and 
      these assays together revealed key nodes controlling redox homeostasis along the 
      KEAP-NRF2 signaling axis. Specifically, targeting KEAP1 in combination with 
      oxidative PPP genes mitigated the deleterious effects of these knockouts on growth 
      rates. These results demonstrate how our integrated framework, combining genetic, 
      transcriptomic, and flux measurements, can improve elucidation of metabolic network 
      alterations and guide precision targeting of metabolic vulnerabilities based on 
      tumor genetics.

AB  - The majority of cancers are driven by multiple genetic alterations, but how these 
      changes collaborate during tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. To gain 
      mechanistic insights into tumor-promoting genetic interactions among tumor 
      suppressor genes (TSG), we conducted combinatorial CRISPR screening coupled with 
      single-cell transcriptomic profiling in human mammary epithelial cells. As expected, 
      different driver gene alterations in mammary epithelial cells influenced the 
      repertoire of tumor suppressor alterations capable of inducing tumor formation. More 
      surprisingly, TSG interaction networks were comprised of numerous cliques-sets of 
      three or four genes such that each TSG within the clique showed oncogenic 
      cooperation with all other genes in the clique. Genetic interaction profiling 
      indicated that the predominant cooperating TSGs shared overlapping functions rather 
      than distinct or complementary functions. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of 
      CRISPR double knockouts revealed that cooperating TSGs that synergized in promoting 
      tumorigenesis and growth factor independence showed transcriptional epistasis, 
      whereas noncooperating TSGs did not. These epistatic transcriptional changes, both 
      buffering and synergistic, affected expression of oncogenic mediators and 
      therapeutic targets, including CDK4, SRPK1, and DNMT1. Importantly, the epistatic 
      expression alterations caused by dual inactivation of TSGs in this system, such as 
      PTEN and TP53, were also observed in patient tumors, establishing the relevance of 
      these findings to human breast cancer. An estimated 50% of differentially expressed 
      genes in breast cancer are controlled by epistatic interactions. Overall, our study 
      indicates that transcriptional epistasis is a central aspect of multigenic breast 
      cancer progression and outlines methodologies to uncover driver gene epistatic 
      networks in other human cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a roadmap for 
      moving beyond discovery and development of therapeutic strategies based on single 
      driver gene analysis to discovery based on interactions between multiple driver 
      genes.See related commentary by Fong et al., p. 6078.

AB  - Vesicluar transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is 
      an essential cellular pathway, but much of its machinery is still unknown. A screen 
      for genes involved in endosome-to-TGN trafficking produced two hits, the adaptor 
      protein-1 (AP-1 complex), which facilitates vesicle budding, and WDR11. Here we 
      demonstrate that WDR11 forms a stable complex with two other proteins, which 
      localises to the TGN region and does not appear to be associated with AP-1, 
      suggesting it may act downstream from budding. In a vesicle tethering assay, capture 
      of vesicles by golgin-245 was substantially reduced in WDR11-knockout cells. 
      Moreover, structured illumination microscopy and relocation assays indicate that the 
      WDR11 complex is initially recruited onto vesicles rather than the TGN, where it may 
      in turn recruit the golgin binding partner TBC1D23. We propose that the complex acts 
      together with TBC1D23 to facilitate the golgin-mediated capture of vesicles that 
      were generated using AP-1.

TI  - FGF10 and the Mystery of Duodenal Atresia in Humans.
PG  - 530

LID - 530
AB  - Background: Duodenal atresia (DA) is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum, which 
      affects 1 in 7000 pregnancies and requires major surgery in the 1st days of life. 
      Three morphological DA types are described. In humans, the association between DA 
      and Down syndrome suggests an underlying, albeit elusive, genetic etiology. In mice, 
      interruption of fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10) gene signaling results in DA in 
      30-50% of embryos, supporting a genetic etiology. This study aims to validate the 
      spectrum of DA in two novel strains of Fgf10 knock-out mice, in preparation for 
      future and translational research. Methods: Two novel CRISPR Fgf10 knock-out mouse 
      strains were derived and embryos generated by heterozygous plug-mating. E15.5-E19.5 
      embryos were genotyped with respect to Fgf10 and micro-dissected to determine the 
      presence and type of DA. Results: One twenty seven embryos (32 wild-type, 34 
      heterozygous, 61 null) were analyzed. No wild-type or heterozygous embryos had DA. 
      However, 74% of Fgf10 null embryos had DA (49% type 1, 18% type 2, and 33% type 3). 
      Conclusion: Our CRISPR-derived strains showed higher penetrance of DA due to 
      single-gene deletion of Fgf10 in mice than previously reported. Further, the DA type 
      distribution in these mice more closely reiterated that observed in humans. Future 
      experiments will document RNA and protein expression of FGF10 and its key downstream 
      signaling targets in normal and atretic duodenum. This includes exploitation of 
      modern, high-fidelity developmental tools, e.g., Fgf10 (flox/+)-tomato(flox/flox) 
      mice.

TI  - Regulation of Gene Expression and the Elucidative Role of CRISPR-Based Epigenetic 
      Modifiers and CRISPR-Induced Chromosome Conformational Changes.
PG  - 43-57
LID - 10.1089/crispr.2020.0108 [doi]
AB  - In complex multicellular systems, gene expression is regulated at multiple stages 
      through interconnected complex molecular pathways and regulatory networks. 
      Transcription is the first step in gene expression and is subject to multiple layers 
      of regulation in which epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone tail 
      modifications, and chromosomal conformation play an essential role. In recent years, 
      CRISPR-Cas9 systems have been employed to unearth this complexity and provide new 
      insights on the contribution of chromatin dysregulation in the development of 
      genetic diseases, as well as new tools to prevent or reverse this dysregulation. In 
      this review, we outline the recent development of a variety of CRISPR-based 
      epigenetic editors for targeted DNA methylation/demethylation, histone modification, 
      and three-dimensional DNA conformational change, highlighting their relative 
      performance and impact on gene regulation. Finally, we provide insights on the 
      future developments aimed to accelerate our understanding of the causal relationship 
      between epigenetic marks, genome organization, and gene regulation.

LID - e9443
AB  - Tumor relapse as a consequence of chemotherapy resistance is a major clinical 
      challenge in advanced stage breast tumors. To identify processes associated with 
      poor clinical outcome, we took a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach and 
      analyzed a breast cancer cohort of 113 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. 
      Proteomic profiling of matched tumors before and after chemotherapy, and 
      tumor-adjacent normal tissue, all from the same patients, allowed us to define eight 
      patterns of protein level changes, two of which correlate to better chemotherapy 
      response. Supervised analysis identified two proteins of proline biosynthesis 
      pathway, PYCR1 and ALDH18A1, that were significantly associated with resistance to 
      treatment based on pattern dominance. Weighted gene correlation network analysis of 
      post-treatment samples revealed that these proteins are associated with tumor 
      relapse and affect patient survival. Functional analysis showed that knockdown of 
      PYCR1 reduced invasion and migration capabilities of breast cancer cell lines. PYCR1 
      knockout significantly reduced tumor burden and increased drug sensitivity of 
      orthotopically injected ER-positive tumor in vivo, thus emphasizing the role of 
      PYCR1 in resistance to chemotherapy.

TI  - Prediction of sgRNA on-target activity in bacteria by deep learning.
PG  - 517
LID - 10.1186/s12859-019-3151-4 [doi]
LID - 517
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the main challenges for the CRISPR-Cas9 system is selecting 
      optimal single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Recently, deep learning has enhanced sgRNA 
      prediction in eukaryotes. However, the prokaryotic chromatin structure is different 
      from eukaryotes, so models trained on eukaryotes may not apply to prokaryotes. 
      RESULTS: We designed and implemented a convolutional neural network to predict sgRNA 
      activity in Escherichia coli. The network was trained and tested on the 
      recently-released sgRNA activity dataset. Our convolutional neural network achieved 
      excellent performance, yielding average Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.5817, 
      0.7105, and 0.3602, respectively for Cas9, eSpCas9 and Cas9 with a recA coding 
      region deletion. We confirmed that the sgRNA prediction models trained on 
      prokaryotes do not apply to eukaryotes and vice versa. We adopted perturbation-based 
      approaches to analyze distinct biological patterns between prokaryotic and 
      eukaryotic editing. Then, we improved the predictive performance of the prokaryotic 
      Cas9 system by transfer learning. Finally, we determined that potential off-target 
      scores accumulated on a genome-wide scale affect on-target activity, which could 
      slightly improve on-target predictive performance. CONCLUSIONS: We developed 
      convolutional neural networks to predict sgRNA activity for wild type and mutant 
      Cas9 in prokaryotes. Our results show that the prediction accuracy of our method is 
      improved over state-of-the-art models.

TI  - The dual role of the centrosome in organizing the microtubule network in interphase.
LID - 10.15252/embr.201845942 [doi]
LID - e45942
AB  - Here, we address the regulation of microtubule nucleation during interphase by 
      genetically ablating one, or two, of three major mammalian γ-TuRC-binding factors 
      namely pericentrin, CDK5Rap2, and AKAP450. Unexpectedly, we find that while all of 
      them participate in microtubule nucleation at the Golgi apparatus, they only 
      modestly contribute at the centrosome where CEP192 has a more predominant function. 
      We also show that inhibiting microtubule nucleation at the Golgi does not affect 
      centrosomal activity, whereas manipulating the number of centrosomes with centrinone 
      modifies microtubule nucleation activity of the Golgi apparatus. In centrosome-free 
      cells, inhibition of Golgi-based microtubule nucleation triggers 
      pericentrin-dependent formation of cytoplasmic-nucleating structures. Further 
      depletion of pericentrin under these conditions leads to the generation of 
      individual microtubules in a γ-tubulin-dependent manner. In all cases, a conspicuous 
      MT network forms. Strikingly, centrosome loss increases microtubule number 
      independently of where they were growing from. Our results lead to an unexpected 
      view of the interphase centrosome that would control microtubule network 
      organization not only by nucleating microtubules, but also by modulating the 
      activity of alternative microtubule-organizing centers.

AB  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) co-ordinates circadian behaviour and physiology in 
      mammals. Its cell-autonomous circadian oscillations pivot around a well 
      characterised transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL), whilst the SCN 
      circuit as a whole is synchronised to solar time by its retinorecipient cells that 
      express and release vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The cell-autonomous and 
      circuit-level mechanisms whereby VIP synchronises the SCN are poorly understood. We 
      show that SCN slices in organotypic culture demonstrate rapid and sustained 
      circuit-level circadian responses to VIP that are mediated at a cell-autonomous 
      level. This is accompanied by changes across a broad transcriptional network and by 
      significant VIP-directed plasticity in the internal phasing of the cell-autonomous 
      TTFL. Signalling via ERK1/2 and tuning by its negative regulator DUSP4 are critical 
      elements of the VIP-directed circadian re-programming. In summary, we provide 
      detailed mechanistic insight into VIP signal transduction in the SCN at the level of 
      genes, cells and neural circuit.

TI  - SYNGAP1 Controls the Maturation of Dendrites, Synaptic Function, and Network 
      Activity in Developing Human Neurons.
PG  - 7980-7994
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1367-20.2020 [doi]
AB  - SYNGAP1 is a major genetic risk factor for global developmental delay, autism 
      spectrum disorder, and epileptic encephalopathy. De novo loss-of-function variants 
      in this gene cause a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by cognitive impairment, 
      social-communication disorder, and early-onset seizures. Cell biological studies in 
      mouse and rat neurons have shown that Syngap1 regulates developing excitatory 
      synapse structure and function, with loss-of-function variants driving formation of 
      larger dendritic spines and stronger glutamatergic transmission. However, studies to 
      date have been limited to mouse and rat neurons. Therefore, it remains unknown how 
      SYNGAP1 loss of function impacts the development and function of human neurons. To 
      address this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to ablate SYNGAP1 protein expression in 
      neurons derived from a commercially available induced pluripotent stem cell line 
      (hiPSC) obtained from a human female donor. Reducing SynGAP protein expression in 
      developing hiPSC-derived neurons enhanced dendritic morphogenesis, leading to larger 
      neurons compared with those derived from isogenic controls. Consistent with larger 
      dendritic fields, we also observed a greater number of morphologically defined 
      excitatory synapses in cultures containing these neurons. Moreover, neurons with 
      reduced SynGAP protein had stronger excitatory synapses and expressed synaptic 
      activity earlier in development. Finally, distributed network spiking activity 
      appeared earlier, was substantially elevated, and exhibited greater bursting 
      behavior in SYNGAP1 null neurons. We conclude that SYNGAP1 regulates the postmitotic 
      maturation of human neurons made from hiPSCs, which influences how activity develops 
      within nascent neural networks. Alterations to this fundamental neurodevelopmental 
      process may contribute to the etiology of SYNGAP1-related disorders.SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT SYNGAP1 is a major genetic risk factor for global developmental delay, 
      autism spectrum disorder, and epileptic encephalopathy. While this gene is well 
      studied in rodent neurons, its function in human neurons remains unknown. We used 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology to disrupt SYNGAP1 protein expression in neurons derived from 
      an induced pluripotent stem cell line. We found that induced neurons lacking SynGAP 
      expression exhibited accelerated dendritic morphogenesis, increased accumulation of 
      postsynaptic markers, early expression of synapse activity, enhanced excitatory 
      synaptic strength, and early onset of neural network activity. We conclude that 
      SYNGAP1 regulates the postmitotic differentiation rate of developing human neurons 
      and disrupting this process impacts the function of nascent neural networks. These 
      altered developmental processes may contribute to the etiology of SYNGAP1 disorders.

AB  - Using nuclease-deficient dead (d)Cas9 without enzymatic activity fused to 
      transcriptional inhibitors (CRISPRi) allows for transcriptional interference and 
      results in a powerful tool for the elucidation of developmental, homeostatic and 
      disease mechanisms. We inserted dCas9KRAB (CRISPRi) cassette into the AAVS1 locus of 
      hiPSC lines, which resulted in homozygous knock-in with an otherwise unaltered 
      genome. Expression of dCas9KRAB protein, pluripotency and the ability to 
      differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers were validated. Furthermore, 
      functional cardiomyocyte generation was tested. The hiPSC-CRISPRi cell lines offer a 
      valuable tool for studying endogenous transcriptional repression with single and 
      multiplexed possibilities in all human cell types.

TI  - Somatic MIWI2 Hinders Direct Lineage Reprogramming From Fibroblast to Hepatocyte.
PG  - 803-812
LID - 10.1002/stem.2994 [doi]
AB  - Remodeling of the gene regulatory network in cells is believed to be a prerequisite 
      for their lineage reprogramming. However, its key regulatory factors are not yet 
      elucidated. In this article, we investigate the role of PIWI proteins and provide 
      evidence that one of them, MIWI2, is elicited during transdifferentiation of 
      fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells. In coincidence with the peak expression of 
      MIWI2, we identified the appearance of a unique intermediate epigenetic state 
      characterized by a specific Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) profile consisting of 219 
      novel sequences. Knockout of MIWI2 greatly improved the formation of the induced 
      hepatocytes, whereas overexpression of exogenous MIWI2 completely abolished the 
      stimulated effect. A bioinformatics analysis of piRNA interaction network, followed 
      by experimental validation, revealed the Notch signaling pathway as one of the 
      immediate effectors of MIWI2. Altogether, our results show for the first time that 
      temporal expression of MIWI2 contributes negatively to cell plasticity not only in 
      germline, but also in developed cells, such as mouse fibroblasts. Stem Cells

TI  - The CD33 short isoform is a gain-of-function variant that enhances Aβ(1-42) 
      phagocytosis in microglia.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/s13024-021-00443-6 [doi]
LID - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: CD33 is genetically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility 
      through differential expression of isoforms in microglia. The role of the human CD33 
      short isoform (hCD33m), preferentially encoded by an AD-protective CD33 allele 
      (rs12459419T), is unknown. Here, we test whether hCD33m represents a 
      loss-of-function or gain-of-function variant. METHODS: We have developed two models 
      to test the role of hCD33m. The first is a new strain of transgenic mice expressing 
      hCD33m in the microglial cell lineage. The second is U937 cells where the CD33 gene 
      was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 and complemented with different variants of hCD33. 
      Primary microglia and U937 cells were tested in phagocytosis assays and single cell 
      RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) was carried out on the primary microglia. Furthermore, a 
      new monoclonal antibody was developed to detect hCD33m more efficiently. RESULTS: In 
      both primary microglia and U937 cells, we find that hCD33m enhances phagocytosis. 
      This contrasts with the human CD33 long isoform (hCD33M) that represses 
      phagocytosis, as previously demonstrated. As revealed by scRNAseq, hCD33m(+) 
      microglia are enriched in a cluster of cells defined by an upregulated expression 
      and gene regulatory network of immediate early genes, which was further validated 
      within microglia in situ. Using a new hCD33m-specific antibody enabled hCD33m 
      expression to be examined, demonstrating a preference for an intracellular location. 
      Moreover, this newly discovered gain-of-function role for hCD33m is dependent on its 
      cytoplasmic signaling motifs, dominant over hCD33M, and not due to loss of glycan 
      ligand binding. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide strong support that hCD33m 
      represents a gain-of-function isoform and offers insight into what it may take to 
      therapeutically capture the AD-protective CD33 allele.

TI  - Dynamics changes of CRISPR-Cas9 systems induced by high fidelity mutations.
PG  - 27439-27448
LID - 10.1039/c8cp04226h [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful genome editing tool, has widely been applied in biological 
      fields. Since the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9 as an adaptive immune system, it has been 
      gradually modified to perform precise genome editing in eukaryotic cells by creating 
      double-strand breaks. Although it is robust and efficient, the current CRISPR-Cas9 
      system faces a major flaw: off-target effects, which are not well understood. 
      Several Cas9 mutants show significant improvement, with very low off-target effects; 
      however, they also show relatively lower cleavage efficiency for on-target 
      sequences. In this study, the dynamics of wild-type Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes 
      and a high fidelity Cas9 mutant have been explored using molecular dynamics 
      simulations. It was found that the mutations cause decreased electrostatic 
      interactions between Cas9 and the R-loop. Consequently, the flexibility of the 
      tDNA/sgRNA heteroduplex is decreased, which may explain the lower tolerance of 
      mismatches in the heteroduplex region. The mutations also affect the protein 
      dynamics and the correlation networks among Cas9 domains. In mutant Cas9, weakened 
      communications between two catalytic domains as well as a slight opening of the 
      conformation induced by the mutations account for the lower on-target cleavage 
      efficiency and probably the lower off-target efficiency as well. These findings will 
      facilitate more precise Cas9 engineering in future.

AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are indispensable in fighting infectious 
      microbes by adopting various antimicrobial strategies including phagocytosis and 
      neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although the role and importance of PMNs in 
      periodontal disease are well established, the specific molecular mechanisms involved 
      in NET formation are yet to be characterized. In the present study, we sought to 
      determine the role of periodontal pathogen on NET formation by utilizing 
      Fusobacterium nucleatum. Our data demonstrates that F. nucleatum activates 
      neutrophils and induces robust NETosis in a time-dependent manner via the 
      upregulation of the Nucleotide oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 receptors. 
      Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of HL-60 cells and the use of ligands/inhibitors 
      confirmed the involvement of NOD1 and NOD2 receptors in F. nucleatum-mediated NET 
      formation. When treated with NOD1 and NOD2 inhibitors, we observed a significant 
      downregulation of peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) activity. In addition, 
      neutrophils showed a significant increase and decrease of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and 
      neutrophil elastase (NE) when treated with NOD1/NOD2 ligands and inhibitors, 
      respectively. Taken together, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of NOD1/NOD2 HL-60 cells and 
      inhibitors of NOD signaling confirmed the role of NLRs in F. nucleatum-mediated 
      NETosis. Our data demonstrates an important pathway linking NOD1 and NOD2 to NETosis 
      by F. nucleatum, a prominent microbe in periodontal biofilms. This is the first 
      study to elucidate the role of NOD-like receptors in NETosis and their downstream 
      signaling network.

TI  - CRISPR-based assessment of genomic structure in the conserved SQUAMOSA 
      promoter-binding-like gene clusters in rice.
PG  - 1301-1314
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15001 [doi]
AB  - Although SQUAMOSA promoter-binding-like (SPL) transcription factors are important 
      regulators of development in rice (Oryza sativa), prior assessments of the SPL 
      family have been limited to single genes. A functional comparison across the full 
      gene family in standardized genetic backgrounds has not been reported previously. 
      Here, we demonstrate that the SPL gene family in rice is enriched due to the most 
      recent whole genome duplication (WGD). Notably, 10 of 19 rice SPL genes (52%) 
      cluster in four units that have persisted for at least 50 million years. We show 
      that SPL gene grouping and retention following WGD is widespread in angiosperms, 
      suggesting the conservatism and importance of this gene arrangement. We used Cas9 
      editing to generate transformation lines for all 19 SPL genes in a common set of 
      backgrounds, and found that knockouts of 14 SPL genes exhibited defects in plant 
      height, 10 exhibited defects in panicle size, and nine had altered grain lengths. We 
      observed subfunctionalization of genes in the paleoduplicated pairs, but little 
      evidence of neofunctionalization. Expression of OsSPL3 was negatively correlated 
      with that of its closest neighbor in its synteny group, OsSPL4, and its sister 
      paired gene, OsSPL12, in the opposing group. Nucleotide diversity was lower in eight 
      of the nine singleton genes in domesticated rice, relative to wild rice, whereas the 
      reverse was true for the paired genes. Together, these results provide functional 
      information on eight previously unexamined OsSPL family members and suggest that 
      paleoduplicate pair redundancy benefits plant survival and innovation.

TI  - Inferring cancer dependencies on metabolic genes from large-scale genetic screens.
PG  - 37

LID - 37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to survive and propagate. Thus, 
      targeting metabolic rewiring in tumors is a promising therapeutic strategy. 
      Genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR screens are powerful tools for identifying genes 
      essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Integrating loss-of-function 
      genetic screens with genomics and transcriptomics datasets reveals molecular 
      mechanisms that underlie cancer cell dependence on specific genes; though explaining 
      cell line-specific essentiality of metabolic genes was recently shown to be 
      especially challenging. RESULTS: We find that variability in tissue culture medium 
      between cell lines in a genetic screen is a major confounding factor affecting cell 
      line-specific essentiality of metabolic genes-while, quite surprisingly, not being 
      previously accounted for. Additionally, we find that altered expression level of a 
      metabolic gene in a certain cell line is less indicative of its essentiality than 
      for other genes. However, cell line-specific essentiality of metabolic genes is 
      significantly correlated with changes in the expression of neighboring enzymes in 
      the metabolic network. Utilizing a machine learning method that accounts for tissue 
      culture media and functional association between neighboring enzymes, we generated 
      predictive models for cancer cell line-specific dependence on 162 metabolic genes 
      (representing a ~ 2.2-fold increase compared to previous studies). The generated 
      predictive models reveal numerous novel associations between molecular features and 
      cell line-specific dependency on metabolic genes. Specifically, we demonstrate how 
      cancer cell dependence on one-carbon metabolic enzymes is explained based on cancer 
      lineage, oncogenic mutations, and RNA expression of neighboring enzymes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Considering culture media as well as accounting for molecular features 
      of functionally related metabolic enzymes in a metabolic network significantly 
      improves our understanding of cancer cell line-specific dependence on metabolic 
      genes. We expect our approach and predictive models of metabolic gene essentiality 
      to be a useful tool for investigating metabolic abnormalities in cancer.

AB  - The complex phenotypes of eukaryotic cells are controlled by decision-making 
      circuits and signaling pathways. A key obstacle to implementing artificial 
      connections in signaling networks has been the lack of synthetic devices for 
      efficient sensing, processing and control of biological signals. By extending sgRNAs 
      to include modified riboswitches that recognize specific signals, we can create 
      CRISPR-Cas9-based 'signal conductors' that regulate transcription of endogenous 
      genes in response to external or internal signals of interest. These devices can be 
      used to construct all the basic types of Boolean logic gates that perform logical 
      signal operations in mammalian cells without needing the layering of multiple 
      genetic circuits. They can also be used to rewire cellular signaling events by 
      constructing synthetic links that couple different signaling pathways. Moreover, 
      this approach can be applied to redirect oncogenic signal transduction by 
      controlling simultaneous bidirectional (ON-OFF) gene transcriptions, thus enabling 
      reprogramming of the fate of cancer cells.

AB  - Promoting sustainable agriculture and improving nutrition are the main united nation 
      sustainable development goals by 2030. New technologies are requested to achieve 
      zero hunger, and genome editing technology is the most promising one. In the last 
      decade, genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas system has attracted researcher as a 
      safer and easy tool for genome editing in several living organisms. GE has 
      revolutionized the field of agriculture by improving biotic and abiotic stresses and 
      yield improvement. GE technologies were developed fast lately to avoid the obstacles 
      that face GM crops. GE technology, depending on site directed nuclease (SDN), is 
      divided into three categories according to the modification methods. Developing 
      transgenic-free edited plants without introducing foreign DNA meet the acceptance 
      and regulatory ratification of several countries. There are several ongoing efforts 
      from different countries are rapidly expanding to adopt the current technological 
      innovations. This review summarizes the different GE technologies and their 
      application as a way to help in ending hunger.

TI  - Polyvalent Proteins, a Pervasive Theme in the Intergenomic Biological Conflicts of 
      Bacteriophages and Conjugative Elements.
LID - 10.1128/JB.00245-17 [doi]
LID - e00245-17
AB  - Intense biological conflicts between prokaryotic genomes and their genomic parasites 
      have resulted in an arms race in terms of the molecular "weaponry" deployed on both 
      sides. Using a recursive computational approach, we uncovered a remarkable class of 
      multidomain proteins with 2 to 15 domains in the same polypeptide deployed by 
      viruses and plasmids in such conflicts. Domain architectures and genomic contexts 
      indicate that they are part of a widespread conflict strategy involving proteins 
      injected into the host cell along with parasite DNA during the earliest phase of 
      infection. Their unique feature is the combination of domains with highly disparate 
      biochemical activities in the same polypeptide; accordingly, we term them polyvalent 
      proteins. Of the 131 domains in polyvalent proteins, a large fraction are enzymatic 
      domains predicted to modify proteins, target nucleic acids, alter nucleotide 
      signaling/metabolism, and attack peptidoglycan or cytoskeletal components. They 
      further contain nucleic acid-binding domains, virion structural domains, and 40 
      novel uncharacterized domains. Analysis of their architectural network reveals both 
      pervasive common themes and specialized strategies for conjugative elements and 
      plasmids or (pro)phages. The themes include likely processing of multidomain 
      polypeptides by zincin-like metallopeptidases and mechanisms to counter restriction 
      or CRISPR/Cas systems and jump-start transcription or replication. DNA-binding 
      domains acquired by eukaryotes from such systems have been reused in 
      XPC/RAD4-dependent DNA repair and mitochondrial genome replication in 
      kinetoplastids. Characterization of the novel domains discovered here, such as 
      RNases and peptidases, are likely to aid in the development of new reagents and 
      elucidation of the spread of antibiotic resistance.IMPORTANCE This is the first 
      report of the widespread presence of large proteins, termed polyvalent proteins, 
      predicted to be transmitted by genomic parasites such as conjugative elements, 
      plasmids, and phages during the initial phase of infection along with their DNA. 
      They are typified by the presence of multiple domains with disparate activities 
      combined in the same protein. While some of these domains are predicted to assist 
      the invasive element in replication, transcription, or protection of their DNA, 
      several are likely to target various host defense systems or modify the host to 
      favor the parasite's life cycle. Notably, DNA-binding domains from these systems 
      have been transferred to eukaryotes, where they have been incorporated into DNA 
      repair and mitochondrial genome replication systems.

TI  - Genetic Reprogramming of the Ergot Alkaloid Pathway of Metarhizium brunneum.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01251-20 [doi]
LID - e01251-20
AB  - Ergot alkaloids are important specialized fungal metabolites that are used to make 
      potent pharmaceuticals for neurological diseases and disorders. Lysergic acid (LA) 
      and dihydrolysergic acid (DHLA) are desirable lead compounds for pharmaceutical 
      semisynthesis but are typically transient intermediates in the ergot alkaloid and 
      dihydroergot alkaloid pathways. Previous work with Neosartorya fumigata demonstrated 
      strategies to produce these compounds as pathway end products, but their percent 
      yield (percentage of molecules in product state as opposed to precursor state) was 
      low. Moreover, ergot alkaloids in N. fumigata are typically retained in the fungus 
      as opposed to being secreted. We used clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and heterologous 
      expression approaches to engineer these compounds in Metarhizium brunneum, 
      representing an alternate expression host from a different lineage of fungi. The 
      relative percent yields of LA (86.9%) and DHLA (72.8%) were much higher than those 
      calculated here for previously engineered strains of N. fumigata (2.6% and 2.0%, 
      respectively). Secretion of these alkaloids also was measured, with averages of 
      98.4% of LA and 87.5% of DHLA being secreted into the growth medium; both values 
      were significantly higher than those measured for the N. fumigata derivatives (both 
      of which were less than 5.6% secreted). We used a similar approach to engineer a 
      novel dihydroergot alkaloid in M. brunneum and, through high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses, provisionally identified it as 
      the dihydrogenated form of lysergic acid α-hydroxyethylamide (dihydro-LAH). The 
      engineering of these strains provides a strategy for producing novel and 
      pharmaceutically important chemicals in a fungus more suitable for their 
      production.IMPORTANCE Ergot alkaloids derived from LA or DHLA are the bases for 
      numerous pharmaceuticals with applications in the treatment of dementia, migraines, 
      hyperprolactinemia, and other conditions. However, extraction of ergot alkaloids 
      from natural sources is inefficient, and their chemical synthesis is expensive. The 
      ability to control and redirect ergot alkaloid synthesis in fungi may allow more 
      efficient production of these important chemicals and facilitate research on novel 
      derivatives. Our results show that Metarhizium brunneum can be engineered to 
      efficiently produce and secrete LA and DHLA and, also, to produce a novel derivative 
      of DHLA not previously found in nature. The engineering of dihydroergot alkaloids, 
      including a novel species, is important because very few natural sources of these 
      compounds are known. Our approach establishes a platform with which to use M. 
      brunneum to study the production of other ergot alkaloids, specifically those 
      classified as lysergic acid amides and dihydroergot alkaloids.

TI  - Profiling the long noncoding RNA interaction network in the regulatory elements of 
      target genes by chromatin in situ reverse transcription sequencing.
PG  - 1521-1532
LID - 10.1101/gr.244996.118 [doi]
AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate the activity of target genes by 
      participating in the organization of chromatin architecture. We have devised a 
      "chromatin-RNA in situ reverse transcription sequencing" (CRIST-seq) approach to 
      profile the lncRNA interaction network in gene regulatory elements by combining the 
      simplicity of RNA biotin labeling with the specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
      Using gene-specific gRNAs, we describe a pluripotency-specific lncRNA interacting 
      network in the promoters of Sox2 and Pou5f1, two critical stem cell factors that are 
      required for the maintenance of pluripotency. The promoter-interacting lncRNAs were 
      specifically activated during reprogramming into pluripotency. Knockdown of these 
      lncRNAs caused the stem cells to exit from pluripotency. In contrast, overexpression 
      of the pluripotency-associated lncRNA activated the promoters of core stem cell 
      factor genes and enhanced fibroblast reprogramming into pluripotency. These 
      CRIST-seq data suggest that the Sox2 and Pou5f1 promoters are organized within a 
      unique lncRNA interaction network that determines the fate of pluripotency during 
      reprogramming. This CRIST approach may be broadly used to map lncRNA interaction 
      networks at target loci across the genome.

LID - e0168387
AB  - Protein translational machinery is an important component of the proteostasis 
      network that maintains cellular proteostasis and regulates aging and other cellular 
      processes. Ample evidence indicates that inhibition of translation initiation factor 
      activities enhances stress resistance in model organisms. Eukaryotic translation 
      initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) acts by joining the pre-40S subunit with the 60S 
      ribosomal unit to form an 80S-like complex during protein translational initiation. 
      Reduced eIF5B expression may disrupt proteostasis and trigger cellular processes 
      associated with stress responses. In this study, the physiological effects of 
      altered eIF5B expression were examined in 293T and HepG2 cells. Cells with 
      eIF5B-knockdown (eIF5B-KN) grew more slowly than control cells, and had a lower 
      level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased resistance to 
      oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy. Proteomic analysis showed that eIF5B 
      knockdown resulted in upregulation of 88 proteins and downregulation of 130 proteins 
      compared with control cells. The differentially expressed proteins were associated 
      with diverse cellular processes including amino acid metabolism, RNA processing and 
      protein metabolism, and DNA synthesis. Autonomous downregulation of the 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway was identified as 
      confirmed by western blotting and qPCR. We proposed that deactivation of MAPK 
      pathway modulated proteostasis and induced prolonged S-phase of the cell-cycle, 
      contributing to the slow growth of eIF5B-KN cells. eIF5B silencing also inactivated 
      the mTOR pathway, downregulated glutamine transporters, enhanced autophagy, and 
      decreased 28S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA expression levels which were reversed by 
      restoration of eIF5B expression. Taken together, these results suggest that eIF5B 
      silencing provides a negative feedback to deactivate MAPK signaling, leading to 
      reduced cell growth. These findings provide a useful resource to further biological 
      exploration of the functions of protein synthesis in regulation of proteostasis and 
      stress responses.

AB  - The EGF signaling pathway specifies neuronal identities in the Drosophila embryo by 
      regulating developmental patterning genes such as intermediate neuroblasts defective 
      (ind). EGFR is activated in the ventral midline and neurogenic ectoderm by the Spitz 
      ligand, which is processed by the Rhomboid protease. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to delete 
      defined rhomboid enhancers mediating expression at each site of Spitz processing. 
      Surprisingly, the neurogenic ectoderm, not the ventral midline, was found to be the 
      dominant source of EGF patterning activity. We suggest that Drosophila is undergoing 
      an evolutionary transition in central nervous system (CNS)-organizing activity from 
      the ventral midline to the neurogenic ectoderm.

TI  - Establishment of knockout adult sea urchins by using a CRISPR-Cas9 system.
PG  - 378-388
LID - 10.1111/dgd.12624 [doi]
AB  - Sea urchins are used as a model organism for research on developmental biology and 
      gene regulatory networks during early development. Gene knockdown by microinjection 
      of morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (MASO) has been used to analyze gene 
      function in early sea urchin embryos. However, as the effect of MASO is not long 
      lasting, it is impossible to perturb genes expressed during late development by 
      MASO. Recent advances in genome editing technologies have enabled gene modification 
      in various organisms. We previously reported genome editing in the sea urchin 
      Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription 
      activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN); however, the efficiencies of these 
      technologies were not satisfactory. Here, we applied clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) technology to 
      knock out the Pks1 gene in H. pulcherrimus. When sgRNAs targeting Pks1, which is 
      required for the biosynthesis of larval pigment, were microinjected into fertilized 
      eggs with SpCas9 mRNA, high-efficiency mutagenesis was achieved within 24 hr post 
      fertilization and SpCas9/sgRNA-injected pluteus larvae had an albino phenotype. One 
      of the sgRNAs yielded 100% mutagenesis efficiency, and no off-target effect was 
      detected. In addition, the albino phenotype was maintained in juvenile sea urchins 
      after metamorphosis, and the knockout sea urchins survived for at least one year and 
      grew to albino adult sea urchins. These findings suggest that knockout adult sea 
      urchins were successfully established and the CRISPR-Cas9 system is a feasible 
      method for analyzing gene functions from late developmental to adult stage.

TI  - Genomic insights into Staphylococcus equorum KS1039 as a potential starter culture 
      for the fermentation of high-salt foods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous comparative genomic analysis of Staphylococcus equorum 
      KS1039 with five S. equorum strains illuminated the genomic basis of its safety and 
      salt tolerance. However, a comprehensive picture of the cellular components and 
      metabolic pathways involved in the degradation of macromolecules and development of 
      sensory properties has not been obtained for S. equorum. Therefore, in this study, 
      we examined the general metabolism of S. equorum based on information obtained from 
      published complete genome sequences of six S. equorum strains isolated from 
      different niches. Additionally, the utility of strain KS1039 as a starter culture 
      for high-salt food fermentations was examined. RESULTS: All six S. equorum strains 
      contained genes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid 
      metabolic pathways, as well as color development. Moreover, the strains had the 
      potential to produce acetoin, butanediol, and branched chain fatty acids, all of 
      which are important flavor compounds. None of the strains contained decarboxylase 
      genes, which are required for histamine and tyramine production. Strain KS1039 
      contained bacteriocin and CRISPR/Cas gene clusters, and experimental results 
      suggested that these genes were functional in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The comparative 
      genomic analysis carried out herein provides important information on the usefulness 
      of S. equorum KS1039 as a starter culture for the fermentation of high-salt foods in 
      terms of safety, salt tolerance, bacteriocin production, and foreign plasmid 
      restriction.

TI  - Imaging endogenous synaptic proteins in primary neurons at single-cell resolution 
      using CRISPR/Cas9.
PG  - 2838-2855
LID - 10.1091/mbc.E19-04-0223 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescence imaging at single-cell resolution is a crucial approach to analyzing 
      the spatiotemporal regulation of proteins within individual cells of complex neural 
      networks. Here we present a nonviral strategy that enables the tagging of endogenous 
      loci by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing combined with a nucleofection technique. 
      The method allowed expression of fluorescently tagged proteins at endogenous levels, 
      and we successfully achieved tagging of a presynaptic protein, synaptophysin (Syp), 
      and a postsynaptic protein, PSD-95, in cultured postmitotic neurons. Superresolution 
      fluorescence microscopy of fixed neurons confirmed the identical localization 
      patterns of the tagged proteins to those of endogenous ones verified by 
      immunohistochemistry. The system is also applicable for multiplexed labeling and 
      live-cell imaging. Live imaging with total internal reflection fluorescence 
      microscopy of a single dendritic process of a neuron double-labeled with Syp-mCherry 
      and PSD-95-EGFP revealed the previously undescribed dynamic localization of the 
      proteins synchronously moving along dendritic shafts. Our convenient and versatile 
      strategy is potent for analysis of proteins whose ectopic expressions perturb 
      cellular functions.

TI  - Identification of SYS1 as a Host Factor Required for Shiga Toxin-Mediated 
      Cytotoxicity in Vero Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22094936 [doi]
LID - 4936
AB  - Shiga toxin (STx) or Vero toxin is a virulence factor produced by enterohemorrhagic 
      Escherichia coli. The toxin binds to the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide 
      (Gb3) for its entry, and causes cell death by inhibiting ribosome function. 
      Previously, we performed a loss-of-function screen in HeLa cells using a human 
      CRISPR knockout (KO) library and identified various host genes required for 
      STx-induced cell death. To determine whether this library targeted to the human 
      genome is applicable to non-human primate cells and to identify previously 
      unrecognized factors crucial for STx-induced cell death, we herein performed a 
      similar screen in the African green monkey kidney-derived Vero C1008 subline. Many 
      genes relevant to metabolic enzymes and membrane trafficking were enriched, although 
      the number of enriched genes was less than that obtained in the screening for HeLa 
      cells. Of note, several genes that had not been enriched in the previous screening 
      were enriched: one of these genes was SYS1, which encodes a multi-spanning membrane 
      protein in the Golgi apparatus. In SYS1 KO Vero cells, expression of Gb3 and 
      sphingomyelin was decreased, while that of glucosylceramide and lactosylceramide was 
      increased. In addition, loss of SYS1 inhibited the biosynthesis of protein glycans, 
      deformed the Golgi apparatus, and perturbed the localization of trans-Golgi network 
      protein (TGN) 46. These results indicate that the human CRISPR KO library is 
      applicable to Vero cell lines, and SYS1 has a widespread effect on glycan 
      biosynthesis via regulation of intra-Golgi and endosome-TGN retrograde transports.

AB  - The retromer complex, which recycles the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate 
      receptor (CI-MPR) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), is thought to 
      consist of a cargo-selective VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer and a membrane-deforming 
      subunit of sorting nexin (SNX)-Bin, Amphyphysin, and Rvs (BAR; SNX-BAR) proteins. In 
      this study, we demonstrate that heterodimers of the SNX-BAR proteins, SNX1, SNX2, 
      SNX5, and SNX6, are the cargo-selective elements that mediate the retrograde 
      transport of CI-MPR from endosomes to the TGN independently of the core retromer 
      trimer. Using quantitative proteomics, we also identify the IGF1R, among more 
      potential cargo, as another SNX5 and SNX6 binding receptor that recycles through 
      SNX-BAR heterodimers, but not via the retromer trimer, in a ligand- and 
      activation-dependent manner. Overall, our data redefine the mechanics of 
      retromer-based sorting and call into question whether retromer indeed functions as a 
      complex of SNX-BAR proteins and the VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 trimer.

AB  - The production of bioactive plant compounds using microbial hosts is considered a 
      safe, cost-competitive and scalable approach to their production. However, microbial 
      production of some compounds like aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived chemicals, 
      remains an outstanding metabolic engineering challenge. Here we present the 
      construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high 
      levels of p-coumaric acid, an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable 
      chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, 
      introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards 
      erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between 
      glycolysis and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several 
      important genes at key nodes between these two pathways. This results in a maximum 
      p-coumaric acid titer of 12.5 g L(-1) and a maximum yield on glucose of 
      154.9 mg g(-1).

AB  - Metabolic engineering typically utilizes a suboptimal step-wise gene target 
      optimization approach to parse a highly connected and regulated cellular metabolism. 
      While the endonuclease-null CRISPR/Cas system has enabled gene expression 
      perturbations without genetic modification, it has been mostly limited to small sets 
      of gene targets in eukaryotes due to inefficient methods to assemble and express 
      large sgRNA operons. In this work, we develop a TEF1p-tRNA expression system and 
      demonstrate that the use of tRNAs as splicing elements flanking sgRNAs provides 
      higher efficiency than both Pol III and ribozyme-based expression across a variety 
      of single sgRNA and multiplexed contexts. Next, we devise and validate a scheme to 
      allow modular construction of tRNA-sgRNA (TST) operons using an iterative Type IIs 
      digestion/ligation extension approach, termed CRISPR-Ligation Extension of sgRNA 
      Operons (LEGO). This approach enables facile construction of large TST operons. We 
      demonstrate this utility by constructing a metabolic rewiring prototype for 
      2,3-butanediol production in 2 distinct yeast strain backgrounds. These results 
      demonstrate that our approach can act as a surrogate for traditional genetic 
      modification on a much shorter design-cycle timescale.

      simultaneously manipulating multiple genes expression are paramount. Previously, we 
      have developed a simple method for generation of an all-in-one CRISPR gRNA 
      expression array. We here present a Golden Gate Assembly-based system of synergistic 
      activation mediator (SAM) compatible CRISPR/dCas9 gRNA expression array for the 
      simultaneous activation of multiple genes. Using this system, we demonstrated the 
      simultaneous activation of the transcription factors, TWIST, SNAIL, SLUG, and ZEB1 a 
      human breast cancer cell line.

AB  - The rat is an important animal model in biomedical research, but practical 
      limitations to genetic manipulation have restricted the application of genetic 
      analysis. Here we report the derivation of rat androgenetic haploid embryonic stem 
      cells (RahESCs) as a tool to facilitate such studies. Our approach is based on 
      removal of the maternal pronucleus from zygotes to generate androgenetic embryos 
      followed by derivation of ESCs. The resulting RahESCs have 21 chromosomes, express 
      pluripotency markers, differentiate into three germ layer cells, and contribute to 
      the germline. Homozygous mutations can be introduced by both large-scale gene 
      trapping and precise gene targeting via homologous recombination or the CRISPR-Cas 
      system. RahESCs can also produce fertile rats after intracytoplasmic injection into 
      oocytes and are therefore able to transmit genetic modifications to offspring. 
      Overall, RahESCs represent a practical tool for functional genetic studies and 
      production of transgenic lines in rat.

TI  - The new kid on the block: a dominant-negative mutation of phototropin1 enhances 
      carotenoid content in tomato fruits.
PG  - 844-861
LID - 10.1111/tpj.15206 [doi]
AB  - Phototropins, the UVA-blue light photoreceptors, endow plants to detect the 
      direction of light and optimize photosynthesis by regulating positioning of 
      chloroplasts and stomatal gas exchange. Little is known about their functions in 
      other developmental responses. A tomato Non-phototropic seedling1 (Nps1) mutant, 
      bearing an Arg495His substitution in the vicinity of LOV2 domain in phototropin1, 
      dominant-negatively blocks phototropin1 responses. The fruits of Nps1 mutant were 
      enriched in carotenoids, particularly lycopene, compared with its parent, Ailsa 
      Craig. On the contrary, CRISPR/CAS9-edited loss of function phototropin1 mutants 
      displayed subdued carotenoids compared with the parent. The enrichment of 
      carotenoids in Nps1 fruits is genetically linked with the mutation and exerted in a 
      dominant-negative fashion. Nps1 also altered volatile profiles with high levels of 
      lycopene-derived 6-methyl 5-hepten2-one. The transcript levels of several MEP and 
      carotenogenesis pathway genes were upregulated in Nps1. Nps1 fruits showed altered 
      hormonal profiles with subdued ethylene emission and reduced respiration. Proteome 
      profiles showed a causal link between higher carotenogenesis and increased levels of 
      protein protection machinery, which may stabilize proteins contributing to MEP and 
      carotenogenesis pathways. The enhancement of carotenoid content by Nps1 in a 
      dominant-negative fashion offers a potential tool for high lycopene-bearing hybrid 
      tomatoes.

AB  - Randomized mutagenesis at an endogenous chromosomal locus is a promising approach 
      for protein engineering, functional assessment of regulatory elements, and modeling 
      genetic variations. In mammalian cells, however, it is challenging to perform 
      site-specific single-nucleotide substitution with single-stranded 
      oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor templates due to insufficient homologous 
      recombination and the infeasibility of positive selection. Here, we developed a DNA 
      transposon based CRISPR-Cas9 regulated transcription and nuclear shuttling (CRONUS) 
      system that enables the stable transduction of CRISPR-Cas9/sgRNA in broad cell 
      types, but avoids undesired genome cleavage in the absence two chemical inducing 
      molecules. Highly efficient single nucleotide alterations induced randomization of 
      desired codons (up to 4 codons) at a defined genomic locus in various human cell 
      lines, including human iPS cells. Thus, CRONUS provides a novel platform for 
      modeling diseases and genetic variations.

TI  - Entropic Stabilization of Cas4 Protein SSO0001 Predicted with Popcoen.
LID - 10.3390/e20080580 [doi]
LID - 580
AB  - Popcoen is a method for configurational entropy estimation of proteins based on 
      machine-learning. Entropy is predicted with an artificial neural network which was 
      trained on simulation trajectories of a large set of representative proteins. 
      Popcoen is extremely fast compared to other approaches based on the sampling of a 
      multitude of microstates. Consequently, Popcoen can be incorporated into a large 
      class of protein software which currently neglects configurational entropy for 
      performance reasons. Here, we apply Popcoen to various conformations of the Cas4 
      protein SSO0001 of Sulfolobus solfataricus, a protein that assembles to a decamer of 
      known toroidal shape. We provide numerical evidence that the native state (NAT) of a 
      SSO0001 monomer has a similar structure to the protomers of the oligomer, where NAT 
      of the monomer is stabilized mainly entropically. Due to its large amount of 
      configurational entropy, NAT has lower free energy than alternative conformations of 
      very low enthalpy and solvation free-energy. Hence, SSO0001 serves as an example 
      case where neglecting configurational entropy leads to incorrect conclusion. Our 
      results imply that no refolding of the subunits is required during oligomerization 
      which suggests that configurational entropy is employed by nature to largely enhance 
      the rate of assembly.

TI  - Gene Editing Correction of a Urea Cycle Defect in Organoid Stem Cell Derived 
      Hepatocyte-like Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22031217 [doi]
LID - 1217
AB  - Urea cycle disorders are enzymopathies resulting from inherited deficiencies in any 
      genes of the cycle. In severe cases, currently available therapies are marginally 
      effective, with liver transplantation being the only definitive treatment. Donor 
      liver availability can limit even this therapy. Identification of novel therapeutics 
      for genetic-based liver diseases requires models that provide measurable hepatic 
      functions and phenotypes. Advances in stem cell and genome editing technologies 
      could provide models for the investigation of cell-based genetic diseases, as well 
      as the platforms for drug discovery. This report demonstrates a practical, and 
      widely applicable, approach that includes the successful reprogramming of somatic 
      cells from a patient with a urea cycle defect, their genetic correction and 
      differentiation into hepatic organoids, and the subsequent demonstration of genetic 
      and phenotypic change in the edited cells consistent with the correction of the 
      defect. While individually rare, there is a large number of other genetic-based 
      liver diseases. The approach described here could be applied to a broad range and a 
      large number of patients with these hepatic diseases where it could serve as an in 
      vitro model, as well as identify successful strategies for corrective cell-based 
      therapy.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9-mediated labelling of the C-terminus of human laminin β1 leads to 
      secretion inhibition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The laminins (LM) are a family of basement membranes glycoproteins with 
      essential roles in supporting epithelia, endothelia, nerves and muscle adhesion, and 
      in regulating a range of processes including cell migration, stem cell maintenance 
      and differentiation. However, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of 
      turnover and remodelling of LM networks due to lack of appropriate tools to study 
      these processes at the necessary resolution. Recently, the nematode C. elegans 
      ortholog of human the LMβ1 chain was labelled at the C-terminus with the 
      photoconvertible fluorophore Dendra2. Here we used genome editing to establish a 
      similar system in a mammalian cell line as proof of concept for future mammalian 
      models. RESULTS: CRISPR-Cas9 was used to introduce the Dendra2 sequence at the 
      C-terminus of LMβ1 in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Despite 
      expression of the tagged protein within cells, no detectable LMβ1-Dendra2 protein 
      was deposited to the extracellular matrices or conditioned media of edited cells. 
      Moreover, the edited cells displayed reduced proliferation rates. Together, these 
      data suggest that, in humans, addition of C-terminal Dendra2 tag to LMβ1 inhibits LM 
      secretion, and is not a viable approach for use in animal models.

TI  - TriTag: an integrative tool to correlate chromatin dynamics and gene expression in 
      living cells.
PG  - e127
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkaa906 [doi]
AB  - A wealth of single-cell imaging studies have contributed novel insights into 
      chromatin organization and gene regulation. However, a comprehensive understanding 
      of spatiotemporal gene regulation requires developing tools to combine multiple 
      monitoring systems in a single study. Here, we report a versatile tag, termed 
      TriTag, which integrates the functional capabilities of CRISPR-Tag (DNA labeling), 
      MS2 aptamer (RNA imaging) and fluorescent protein (protein tracking). Using this 
      tag, we correlate changes in chromatin dynamics with the progression of endogenous 
      gene expression, by recording both transcriptional bursting and protein production. 
      This strategy allows precise measurements of gene expression at single-allele 
      resolution across the cell cycle or in response to stress. TriTag enables capturing 
      an integrated picture of gene expression, thus providing a powerful tool to study 
      transcriptional heterogeneity and regulation.

TI  - CRISPR interference-guided modulation of glucose pathways to boost aconitic acid 
      production in Escherichia coli.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One major mission of microbial breeding is high-level production of 
      desired metabolites. Overproduction of intermediate metabolites in core pathways is 
      challenging as it may impair cell growth and viability. RESULTS: Here we report that 
      aconitic acid, an intermediate metabolite in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, can be 
      overproduced by an engineered CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in Escherichia 
      coli. This CRISPRi system was designed to simultaneously target pyruvate kinase (PK) 
      and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), two enzymes in glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle, 
      respectively. Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR and enzyme activity assays 
      showed that this engineered CRISPRi system significantly repressed the genes 
      encoding IDH and PK, resulting in simultaneous reduction in the activities of IDH 
      and PK. In shake-flask and fed-batch cultivation, this CRISPRi strain produced 
      60-fold (362.80 ± 22.05 mg/L) and 15-fold (623.80 ± 20.05 mg/L) of aconitic acid 
      relative to the control strain, respectively. In addition, this two-target CRISPRi 
      strain maintained low levels of acetate and lactate, two problematic byproducts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that CRISPRi system can improve aconitic acid 
      production by coordinating glycolysis and TCA cycle. This study provides insights 
      for high-level production of the intermediate metabolites in central pathways.

TI  - Genome-Wide CRISPR Screen Reveals Autophagy Disruption as the Convergence Mechanism 
      That Regulates the NRF2 Transcription Factor.
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00037-19 [doi]
LID - e00037-19
AB  - The nuclear factor (erythroid 2)-like 2 (NRF2 or NFE2L2) transcription factor 
      regulates the expression of many genes that are critical in maintaining cellular 
      homeostasis. Its deregulation has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer 
      and metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. While several mechanisms by which NRF2 
      can be activated have gradually been identified over time, a more complete 
      regulatory network of NRF2 is still lacking. Here we show through a genome-wide 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) screen that a 
      total of 273 genes, when knocked out, will lead to sustained NRF2 activation. 
      Pathway analysis revealed a significant overrepresentation of genes (18 of the 273 
      genes) involved in autophagy. Molecular validation of a subset of the enriched genes 
      identified 8 high-confidence genes that negatively regulate NRF2 activity 
      irrespective of cell type: ATG12, ATG7, GOSR1, IFT172, NRXN2, RAB6A, VPS37A, and the 
      well-known negative regulator of NRF2, KEAP1 Of these, ATG12, ATG7, KEAP1, and 
      VPS37A are known to be involved in autophagic processes. Our results present a 
      comprehensive list of NRF2 negative regulators and reveal an intimate link between 
      autophagy and NRF2 regulation.

TI  - Histone variant dictates fate biasing of neural crest cells to melanocyte lineage.
LID - dev182576 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/dev.182576 [doi]
AB  - In the neural crest lineage, progressive fate restriction and stem cell assignment 
      are crucial for both development and regeneration. Whereas fate commitment events 
      have distinct transcriptional footprints, fate biasing is often transitory and 
      metastable, and is thought to be moulded by epigenetic programmes. Therefore, the 
      molecular basis of specification is difficult to define. In this study, we 
      established a role for a histone variant, H2a.z.2, in specification of the 
      melanocyte lineage from multipotent neural crest cells. H2a.z.2 silencing reduces 
      the number of melanocyte precursors in developing zebrafish embryos and from mouse 
      embryonic stem cells in vitro We demonstrate that this histone variant occupies 
      nucleosomes in the promoter of the key melanocyte determinant mitf, and enhances its 
      induction. CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis of this gene in zebrafish 
      drastically reduces adult melanocytes, as well as their regeneration. Thereby, our 
      study establishes the role of a histone variant upstream of the core gene regulatory 
      network in the neural crest lineage. This epigenetic mark is a key determinant of 
      cell fate and facilitates gene activation by external instructive signals, thereby 
      establishing melanocyte fate identity.

AB  - Gametocytes differentiation to gametes (gametogenesis) within mosquitos is essential 
      for malaria parasite transmission. Both reduction in temperature and 
      mosquito-derived XA or elevated pH are required for triggering cGMP/PKG dependent 
      gametogenesis. However, the parasite molecule for sensing or transducing these 
      environmental signals to initiate gametogenesis remains unknown. Here we perform a 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based functional screening of 59 membrane proteins expressed in the 
      gametocytes of Plasmodium yoelii and identify that GEP1 is required for 
      XA-stimulated gametogenesis. GEP1 disruption abolishes XA-stimulated cGMP synthesis 
      and the subsequent signaling and cellular events, such as Ca(2+) mobilization, 
      gamete formation, and gametes egress out of erythrocytes. GEP1 interacts with GCα, a 
      cGMP synthesizing enzyme in gametocytes. Both GEP1 and GCα are expressed in 
      cytoplasmic puncta of both male and female gametocytes. Depletion of GCα impairs 
      XA-stimulated gametogenesis, mimicking the defect of GEP1 disruption. The 
      identification of GEP1 being essential for gametogenesis provides a potential new 
      target for intervention of parasite transmission.

TI  - LGP2 virus sensor regulates gene expression network mediated by TRBP-bound 
      microRNAs.
PG  - 9134-9147
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky575 [doi]
AB  - Here we show that laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) virus sensor 
      protein regulates gene expression network of endogenous genes mediated by TAR-RNA 
      binding protein (TRBP)-bound microRNAs (miRNAs). TRBP is an enhancer of RNA 
      silencing, and functions to recruit precursor-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) to Dicer that 
      processes pre-miRNA into mature miRNA. Viral infection activates the antiviral 
      innate immune response in mammalian cells. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I 
      (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I, melanoma-differentiation-associated 
      gene 5 (MDA5), and LGP2, function as cytoplasmic virus sensor proteins during viral 
      infection. RIG-I and MDA5 can distinguish between different types of RNA viruses to 
      produce antiviral cytokines, including type I interferon. However, the role of LGP2 
      is controversial. We found that LGP2 bound to the double-stranded RNA binding sites 
      of TRBP, resulting in inhibition of pre-miRNA binding and recruitment by TRBP. 
      Furthermore, although it is unclear whether TRBP binds to specific pre-miRNA, we 
      found that TRBP bound to particular pre-miRNAs with common structural 
      characteristics. Thus, LGP2 represses specific miRNA activities by interacting with 
      TRBP, resulting in selective regulation of target genes. Our findings show that a 
      novel function of LGP2 is to modulate RNA silencing, indicating the crosstalk 
      between RNA silencing and RLR signaling in mammalian cells.

TI  - Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in p53-edited PFF cells.
PG  - 949-959
LID - 10.1080/15384101.2020.1742852 [doi]
AB  - p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers, with over half of all 
      tumors harboring mutation at this locus. R248 and R249 (corresponding to porcine 
      R241 and R242), are among the hotspot mutations frequently mutated in liver, lung, 
      breast, and some other cancers. In this study, p53 gene was knocked out or 
      point-edited (R241 and R242 were converted to 241W and 242S) in porcine fetal 
      fibroblast (PFF) cells via CRISPR-Cas9 technique. High throughput sequencing of 
      miRNA and mRNA uncovered a total of 225 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 
      738 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the p53 knockout (p53-KO) cells, and a 
      total of 211 DEMs and 722 DEGs in the point-modified (p53-241W242S) cells. Totally 
      28 annotated DEMs were found to overlap between p53-KO/p53-WT and 
      p53-241W242S/p53-WT miRNAs datasets, of which miR-34 c, miR-218, miR-205, miR-105-1, 
      miR-105-2, miR-206, miR-224 and miR-429 play important roles in p53 regulatory 
      network. Among the top 10 DEGs in p53-KO and p53-241W242S cells, most genes were 
      reported to be involved in tumors, cell proliferation or cell migration. p53-KO and 
      p53-241W242S cells showed a significantly higher (P < 0.01) proliferation rate 
      compared with p53-WT cells. In conclusion, genetic modifications of p53 gene 
      significantly affect the expression levels of a large number of genes and miRNAs in 
      the PFF cells. The p53-edited PFF cells could be used as non-tumor cell models for 
      investigating the p53 signaling network, and as donor cells for somatic nuclear 
      transfer, with the aim to develop porcine models with the corresponding p53 
      mutations.Abbreviations: CRISPR-Cas9: Clustered regularly interspaced short

AB  - The concerted action of multiple genes in a time-dependent manner controls complex 
      cellular phenotypes, yet the temporal regulation of gene expressions is restricted 
      on a single-gene level, which limits our ability to control higher-order gene 
      networks and understand the consequences of multiplex genetic perturbations. Here we 
      developed a system for temporal regulation of multiple genes. This system combines 
      the simplicity of CRISPR/Cas9 activators for orthogonal targeting of multiple genes 
      and the orthogonality of chemically induced dimerizing (CID) proteins for temporal 
      control of CRISPR/Cas9 activator function. In human cells, these transcription 
      activators exerted simultaneous activation of multiple genes and orthogonal 
      regulation of different genes in a ligand-dependent manner with minimal background. 
      We envision that our system will enable the perturbation of higher-order gene 
      networks with high temporal resolution and accelerate our understanding of gene-gene 
      interactions in a complex biological setting.

TI  - Role of the ESCRT-III complex in controlling integrity of the Salmonella-containing 
      vacuole.
PG  - e13176
LID - 10.1111/cmi.13176 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular pathogens need to establish specialised niches for survival and 
      proliferation in host cells. The enteropathogen Salmonella enterica accomplishes 
      this by extensive reorganisation of the host endosomal system deploying the 
      SPI2-encoded type III secretion system (SPI2-T3SS). Fusion events of endosomal 
      compartments with the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) form elaborate membrane 
      networks within host cells enabling intracellular nutrition. However, which host 
      compartments exactly are involved in this process and how the integrity of 
      Salmonella-modified membranes is accomplished are not fully resolved. An RNA 
      interference knockdown screen of host factors involved in cellular logistics 
      identified the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) system as 
      important for proper formation and integrity of the SCV in infected epithelial 
      cells. We demonstrate that subunits of the ESCRT-III complex are specifically 
      recruited to the SCV and membrane network. To investigate the role of ESCRT-III for 
      the intracellular lifestyle of Salmonella, a CHMP3 knockout cell line was generated. 
      Infected CHMP3 knockout cells formed amorphous, bulky SCV. Salmonella within these 
      amorphous SCV were in contact with host cell cytosol, and the attenuation of an 
      SPI2-T3SS-deficient mutant strain was partially abrogated. ESCRT-dependent 
      endolysosomal repair mechanisms have recently been described for other intracellular 
      pathogens, and we hypothesise that minor damages of the SCV during bacterial 
      proliferation are repaired by the action of ESCRT-III recruitment in 
      Salmonella-infected host cells.

AB  - Multiplex navigation of global regulatory networks (MINR) is an approach for 
      combinatorially reprogramming gene expression to manipulate complex phenotypes. We 
      designed, constructed, and mapped MINR libraries containing 43,020 specific 
      mutations in 25 regulatory genes expected to perturb the yeast regulatory network. 
      We selected growth competition experiments for library mutants conferring increased 
      ethanol and/or glucose tolerance. We identified specific mutants that not only 
      possessed improved ethanol and/or glucose tolerance but also produced ethanol at 
      concentrations up to 2-fold higher than those produced by the wild-type strain. We 
      further determined that mutations increasing ethanol tolerance were transferable to 
      a diploid industrial yeast strain. The facile construction and mapping of 43,020 
      designer regulatory mutations provide a roadmap for how to access and engineer 
      complex phenotypes in future synthetic biology and broader efforts.

AB  - To fully exploit the microbial genome resources, a high-throughput experimental 
      platform is needed to associate genes with phenotypes at the genome level. We 
      present here a novel method that enables investigation of the cellular consequences 
      of repressing individual transcripts based on the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) 
      pooled screening in bacteria. We identify rules for guide RNA library design to 
      handle the unique structure of prokaryotic genomes by tiling screening and construct 
      an E. coli genome-scale guide RNA library (~60,000 members) accordingly. We show 
      that CRISPRi outperforms transposon sequencing, the benchmark method in the 
      microbial functional genomics field, when similar library sizes are used or gene 
      length is short. This tool is also effective for mapping phenotypes to non-coding 
      RNAs (ncRNAs), as elucidated by a comprehensive tRNA-fitness map constructed here. 
      Our results establish CRISPRi pooled screening as a powerful tool for mapping 
      complex prokaryotic genetic networks in a precise and high-throughput manner.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 technology based on nuclease inactive dCas9 and fused to the 
      heterotrimeric VPR transcriptional activator is a powerful tool to enhance 
      endogenous transcription by targeting defined genomic loci. We generated homozygous 
      human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines carrying dCas9 fused to VPR along 
      with a WPRE element at the AAVS1 locus (CRISPRa2). We demonstrated pluripotency, 
      genomic integrity and differentiation potential into all three germ layers. CRISPRa2 
      cells showed increased transgene expression and higher transcriptional induction in 
      hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes compared to a previously described CRISPRa line. Both 
      lines allow studying endogenous transcriptional modulation with lower and higher 
      transcript abundance.

AB  - The reproductive strategies of plants are highly variable. Short-lived annuals 
      flower abundantly soon after germination, whereas longer-lived perennials postpone 
      and spatially restrict flowering. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and interspecies gene transfer 
      to understand divergence in reproductive patterns between annual and perennial 
      crucifers. We show that in perennial Arabis alpina, flowering in response to winter 
      cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 
      (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold 
      exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced 
      flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the 
      photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual 
      response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in 
      annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct 
      flowering pathways acting in parallel.

PG  - 1429-1441
LID - 10.1101/gr.244780.118 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations have been identified in hormone 
      therapy-resistant breast cancer and primary endometrial cancer. Analyses in breast 
      cancer suggest that mutant ESR1 exhibits estrogen-independent activity. In 
      endometrial cancer, ESR1 mutations are associated with worse outcomes and less 
      obesity, however, experimental investigation of these mutations has not been 
      performed. Using a unique CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, we introduced the D538G mutation, a 
      common endometrial cancer mutation that alters the ligand binding domain of ESR1, 
      while epitope tagging the endogenous locus. We discovered estrogen-independent 
      mutant ESR1 genomic binding that is significantly altered from wild-type ESR1. The 
      D538G mutation impacted expression, including a large set of nonestrogen-regulated 
      genes, and chromatin accessibility, with most affected loci bound by mutant ESR1. 
      Mutant ESR1 is distinct from constitutive ESR1 activity because mutant-specific 
      changes are not recapitulated with prolonged estrogen exposure. Overall, the D538G 
      mutant ESR1 confers estrogen-independent activity while causing additional 
      regulatory changes in endometrial cancer cells that are distinct from breast cancer 
      cells.

TI  - OTX2 represses sister cell fate choices in the developing retina to promote 
      photoreceptor specification.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.54279 [doi]
LID - e54279
AB  - During vertebrate retinal development, subsets of progenitor cells generate progeny 
      in a non-stochastic manner, suggesting that these decisions are tightly regulated. 
      However, the gene-regulatory network components that are functionally important in 
      these progenitor cells are largely unknown. Here we identify a functional role for 
      the OTX2 transcription factor in this process. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was used to 
      produce somatic mutations of OTX2 in the chick retina and identified similar 
      phenotypes to those observed in human patients. Single cell RNA sequencing was used 
      to determine the functional consequences OTX2 gene editing on the population of 
      cells derived from OTX2-expressing retinal progenitor cells. This confirmed that 
      OTX2 is required for the generation of photoreceptors, but also for repression of 
      specific retinal fates and alternative gene regulatory networks. These include 
      specific subtypes of retinal ganglion and horizontal cells, suggesting that in this 
      context, OTX2 functions to repress sister cell fate choices.

TI  - SOX2 plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and lineage segregation during 
      porcine pre-implantation embryo development.
PG  - e13097
LID - 10.1111/cpr.13097 [doi]
LID - e13097
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gene regulation in early embryos has been widely studied for a long time 
      because lineage segregation gives rise to the formation of a pluripotent cell 
      population, known as the inner cell mass (ICM), during pre-implantation embryo 
      development. The extraordinarily longer pre-implantation embryo development in pigs 
      leads to the distinct features of the pluripotency network compared with mice and 
      humans. For these reasons, a comparative study using pre-implantation pig embryos 
      would provide new insights into the mammalian pluripotency network and help to 
      understand differences in the roles and networks of genes in pre-implantation 
      embryos between species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyse the functions of SOX2 in 
      lineage segregation and cell proliferation, loss- and gain-of-function studies were 
      conducted in pig embryos using an overexpression vector and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. 
      Then, we analysed the morphological features and examined the effect on the 
      expression of downstream genes through immunocytochemistry and quantitative 
      real-time PCR. RESULTS: Our results showed that among the core pluripotent factors, 
      only SOX2 was specifically expressed in the ICM. In SOX2-disrupted blastocysts, the 
      expression of the ICM-related genes, but not OCT4, was suppressed, and the total 
      cell number was also decreased. Likewise, according to real-time PCR analysis, 
      pluripotency-related genes, excluding OCT4, and proliferation-related genes were 
      decreased in SOX2-targeted blastocysts. In SOX2-overexpressing embryos, the total 
      blastocyst cell number was greatly increased but the ICM/TE ratio decreased. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results demonstrated that SOX2 is essential for ICM 
      formation and cell proliferation in porcine early-stage embryogenesis.

AB  - Cpf1 has been harnessed as a tool for genome manipulation in various species because 
      of its simplicity and high efficiency. Our recent study demonstrated that FnCpf1 
      could be utilized for human genome editing with notable advantages for target 
      sequence selection due to the flexibility of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 
      sequence. Multiplex genome editing provides a powerful tool for targeting members of 
      multigene families, dissecting gene networks, modeling multigenic disorders in vivo, 
      and applying gene therapy. However, there are no reports at present that show 
      FnCpf1-mediated multiplex genome editing via a single customized CRISPR RNA (crRNA) 
      array. In the present study, we utilize a single customized crRNA array to 
      simultaneously target multiple genes in human cells. In addition, we also 
      demonstrate that a single customized crRNA array to target multiple sites in one 
      gene could be achieved. Collectively, FnCpf1, a powerful genome-editing tool for 
      multiple genomic targets, can be harnessed for effective manipulation of the human 
      genome.

AB  - The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 has applied as an efficient gene-editing method in 
      malaria parasite Plasmodium. However, the size (4.2 kb) of the commonly used Cas9 
      from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) limits its utility for genome editing in the 
      parasites only introduced with cas9 plasmid. To establish the endogenous and 
      constitutive expression of Cas9 protein in the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii, we 
      replaced the coding region of an endogenous gene sera1 with the intact SpCas9 coding 
      sequence using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing method, generating the 
      cas9-knockin parasite (PyCas9ki) of the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii. The 
      resulted PyCas9ki parasite displays normal progression during the whole life cycle 
      and possesses the Cas9 protein expression in asexual blood stage. By introducing the 
      plasmid (pYCs) containing only sgRNA and homologous template elements, we 
      successfully achieved both deletion and tagging modifications for different 
      endogenous genes in the genome of PyCas9ki parasite. This cas9-knockin PyCas9ki 
      parasite provides a new platform facilitating gene functions study in the rodent 
      malaria parasite P. yoelii.

AB  - The transcription factor vitamin D receptor (VDR) is the high affinity nuclear 
      target of the biologically active form of vitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)). In order 
      to identify pure genomic transcriptional effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), we used VDR 
      cistrome, transcriptome and open chromatin data, obtained from the human monocytic 
      cell line THP-1, for a novel hierarchical analysis applying three bioinformatics 
      approaches. We predicted 75.6% of all early 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responding (2.5 or 4 h) 
      and 57.4% of the late differentially expressed genes (24 h) to be primary VDR target 
      genes. VDR knockout led to a complete loss of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced genome-wide 
      gene regulation. Thus, there was no indication of any VDR-independent non-genomic 
      actions of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) modulating its transcriptional response. Among the 
      predicted primary VDR target genes, 47 were coding for transcription factors and 
      thus may mediate secondary 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) responses. CEBPA and ETS1 ChIP-seq data 
      and RNA-seq following CEBPA knockdown were used to validate the predicted regulation 
      of secondary vitamin D target genes by both transcription factors. In conclusion, a 
      directional network containing 47 partly novel primary VDR target transcription 
      factors describes secondary responses in a highly complex vitamin D signaling 
      cascade. The central transcription factor VDR is indispensable for all 
      transcriptome-wide effects of the nuclear hormone.

AB  - Developmental genes are often regulated by multiple enhancers exhibiting similar 
      spatiotemporal outputs, which are generally considered redundantly acting though few 
      have been studied functionally. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we created deletions of two 
      enhancers, brk5' and brk3', that drive similar but not identical expression of the 
      gene brinker (brk) in early Drosophila embryos. Utilizing both in situ hybridization 
      and quantitative mRNA analysis, we investigated the changes in the gene network 
      state caused by the removal of one or both of the early acting enhancers. brk5' 
      deletion generally phenocopied the gene mutant, including expansion of the BMP 
      ligand decapentaplegic (dpp) as well as inducing variability in amnioserosa tissue 
      cell number suggesting a loss of canalization. In contrast, brk3' deletion presented 
      unique phenotypes including dorsal expansion of several ventrally expressed genes 
      and a decrease in amnioserosa cell number. Similarly, deletions were made for two 
      enhancers associated with the gene short-gastrulation (sog), sog.int and sog.dist, 
      demonstrating that they also exhibit distinct patterning phenotypes and affect 
      canalization. In summary, this study shows that similar gene expression driven by 
      coacting enhancers can support distinct, and sometimes complementary, functions 
      within gene regulatory networks and, moreover, that phenotypes associated with 
      individual enhancer deletion mutants can provide insight into new gene functions.

TI  - Design, execution, and analysis of CRISPR-Cas9-based deletions and genetic

AB  - The study of fungal pathogens is of immediate importance, yet progress is hindered 
      by the technical challenges of genetic manipulation. For Candida species, their 
      inability to maintain plasmids, unusual codon usage, and inefficient homologous 
      recombination are among the obstacles limiting efficient genetic manipulation. New 
      advances in genomic biotechnologies-particularly CRISPR-based tools-have 
      revolutionized genome editing for many fungal species. Here, we present a protocol 
      for CRISPR-Cas9-based manipulation in Candida albicans using a modified 
      gene-drive-based strategy that takes ~1 month to complete. We detail the generation 
      of Candida-optimized Cas9-based plasmids for gene deletion, an efficient 
      transformation protocol using C. albicans haploids, and an optimized mating strategy 
      to generate homozygous single- and double-gene diploid mutants. We further describe 
      protocols for quantifying cell growth and analysis pipelines to calculate fitness 
      and genetic interaction scores for genetic mutants. This protocol overcomes previous 
      limitations associated with genetic manipulation in C. albicans and advances 
      researchers' ability to perform genetic analysis in this pathogen; the protocol also 
      has broad applicability to other mating-competent microorganisms.

TI  - An intergenic "safe haven" region in Cryptococcus neoformans serotype D genomes.
PG  - 103464

LID - 10.1016/j.fgb.2020.103464 [doi]
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic human fungal pathogen and serves as a 
      model organism for studies of eukaryotic microbiology and microbial pathogenesis. C. 
      neoformans species complex is classified into serotype A, serotype D, and AD 
      hybrids, which are currently considered different subspecies. Different serotype 
      strains display varied phenotypes, virulence, and gene regulation. Genetic 
      investigation of important pathways is often performed in both serotype A and D 
      reference strains in order to identify diversification or conservation of the 
      interrogated signaling network. Many genetic tools have been developed for C. 
      neoformans serotype A reference strain H99, including the gene free "safe haven" 
      (SH) regions for DNA integration identified based on genomic features. However, no 
      such a genomic safe haven region has been identified in serotype D strains. Here, 
      capitalizing on the available genomic, transcriptomic, and chromatin data, we 
      identified an intergenic region named as SH3 for the serotype D reference strains 
      JEC21 and XL280. We also designed a sgRNA and a vector facilitating any alien gene 
      integration into SH3 through a CRISPR-Cas9 system. We found that gene inserted in 
      this region complemented the corresponding gene deletion mutant. Fluorescent 
      reporter gene inserted in SH3 can also be expressed efficiently. Insertion in SH3 
      itself did not alter the expression of adjacent genes and did not affect the growth 
      or mating of C. neoformans. Thus, SH3 provides a resource for genetic manipulations 
      in serotype D strains and will facilitate comparative analyses of gene functions in 
      this species complex. In addition, the incorporation of the multi-omic data in our 
      selection of the safe haven region could help similar studies in other organisms.

TI  - Genetic Manipulation of Transcriptional Regulators Alters Nicotine Biosynthesis in 
      Tobacco.
PG  - 1041-1053
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcaa036 [doi]
AB  - The toxic alkaloid nicotine is produced in the roots of Nicotiana species and 
      primarily accumulates in leaves as a specialized metabolite. A series of metabolic 
      and transport genes involved in the nicotine pathway are coordinately upregulated by 
      a pair of jasmonate-responsive AP2/ERF-family transcription factors, NtERF189 and 
      NtERF199, in the roots of Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco). In this study, we explored 
      the potential of manipulating the expression of these transcriptional regulators to 
      alter nicotine biosynthesis in tobacco. The transient overexpression of NtERF189 led 
      to alkaloid production in the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana alata. 
      This ectopic production was further enhanced by co-overexpressing a gene encoding a 
      basic helix-loop-helix-family MYC2 transcription factor. Constitutive and 
      leaf-specific overexpression of NtERF189 increased the accumulation of foliar 
      alkaloids in transgenic tobacco plants but negatively affected plant growth. By 
      contrast, in a knockout mutant of NtERF189 and NtERF199 obtained through 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, alkaloid levels were drastically reduced without 
      causing major growth defects. Metabolite profiling revealed the impact of 
      manipulating the nicotine pathway on a wide range of nitrogen- and carbon-containing 
      metabolites. Our findings provide insights into the biotechnological applications of 
      engineering metabolic pathways by targeting transcription factors.

TI  - A critical role of PRDM14 in human primordial germ cell fate revealed by inducible 
      degrons.
PG  - 1282
LID - 10.1038/s41467-020-15042-0 [doi]
LID - 1282
AB  - PRDM14 is a crucial regulator of mouse primordial germ cells (mPGCs), epigenetic 
      reprogramming and pluripotency, but its role in the evolutionarily divergent 
      regulatory network of human PGCs (hPGCs) remains unclear. Besides, a previous 
      knockdown study indicated that PRDM14 might be dispensable for human germ cell fate. 
      Here, we decided to use inducible degrons for a more rapid and comprehensive PRDM14 
      depletion. We show that PRDM14 loss results in significantly reduced specification 
      efficiency and an aberrant transcriptome of hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) obtained in 
      vitro from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and 
      transcriptomic analyses suggest that PRDM14 cooperates with TFAP2C and BLIMP1 to 
      upregulate germ cell and pluripotency genes, while repressing WNT signalling and 
      somatic markers. Notably, PRDM14 targets are not conserved between mouse and human, 
      emphasising the divergent molecular mechanisms of PGC specification. The 
      effectiveness of degrons for acute protein depletion is widely applicable in various 
      developmental contexts.

AB  - Acidothermus cellulolyticus CRISPR-Cas9 (AceCas9) is a thermophilic Type II-C enzyme 
      that has potential genome editing applications in extreme environments. It cleaves 
      DNA with a 5'-NNNCC-3' Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) and is sensitive to its 
      methylation status. To understand the molecular basis for the high specificity of 
      AceCas9 for its PAM, we determined two crystal structures of AceCas9 lacking its HNH 
      domain (AceCas9-ΔHNH) bound with a single guide RNA and DNA substrates, one with the 
      correct and the other with an incorrect PAM. Three residues, Glu1044, Arg1088, 
      Arg1091, form an intricate hydrogen bond network with the first cytosine and the two 
      opposing guanine nucleotides to confer specificity. Methylation of the first but not 
      the second cytosine base abolishes AceCas9 activity, consistent with the observed 
      PAM recognition pattern. The high sensitivity of AceCas9 to the modified cytosine 
      makes it a potential device for detecting epigenomic changes in genomes.

TI  - WNT-3A-induced β-catenin signaling does not require signaling through heterotrimeric 
      G proteins.
PG  - 11677-11684
LID - 10.1074/jbc.AC119.009412 [doi]
AB  - The network of Wingless/Int-1 (WNT)-induced signaling pathways includes 
      β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways. β-Catenin regulates T cell 
      factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF)-mediated gene transcription, and 
      in response to WNTs, β-catenin signaling is initiated through engagement of a 
      Frizzled (FZD)/LDL receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) receptor complex. FZDs are 
      G protein-coupled receptors, but the question of whether heterotrimeric G proteins 
      are involved in WNT/β-catenin signaling remains unanswered. Here, we investigate 
      whether acute activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling by purified WNT-3A requires 
      functional signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins. Using genome editing, we 
      ablated expression of G(s)/G(olf)/G(q)/G(11)/G(12)/G(13)/G(z) in HEK293 (ΔG7) cells, 
      leaving the expression of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G(i/o) proteins unchanged, 
      to assess whether WNT-3A activates WNT/β-catenin signaling in WT and ΔG7 cells 
      devoid of functional G protein signaling. We monitored WNT-3A-induced activation by 
      detection of phosphorylation of LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), 
      electrophoretic mobility shift of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled (DVL), β-catenin 
      stabilization and dephosphorylation, and TCF-dependent transcription. We found that 
      purified, recombinant WNT-3A efficiently induces WNT/β-catenin signaling in ΔG7 
      cells in both the absence and presence of G(i/o)-blocking PTX. Furthermore, cells 
      completely devoid of G protein expression, so called Gα-depleted HEK293 cells, 
      maintain responsiveness to WNT-3A with regard to the hallmarks of WNT/β-catenin 
      signaling. These findings corroborate the concept that heterotrimeric G proteins are 
      not required for this FZD- and DVL-mediated signaling branch. Our observations agree 
      with previous results arguing for FZD conformation-dependent functional selectivity 
      between DVL and heterotrimeric G proteins. In conclusion, WNT/β-catenin signaling 
      through FZDs does not require the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins.

AB  - Comprehensive delineation of complex cellular networks requires high-throughput 
      interrogation of genetic interactions. To address this challenge, we describe the 
      development of a multiplex combinatorial strategy to assess pairwise genetic 
      interactions using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and next-generation sequencing. We 
      characterize the performance of combinatorial genome editing and analysis using 
      different promoter and gRNA designs and identified regions of the chimeric RNA that 
      are compatible with next-generation sequencing preparation and quantification. This 
      approach is an important step towards elucidating genetic networks relevant to human 
      diseases and the development of more efficient Cas9-based therapeutics.

AB  - Sea urchin embryos are a useful model system for investigating early developmental 
      processes and the underlying gene regulatory networks. Most functional studies using 
      sea urchin embryos rely on antisense morpholino oligonucleotides to knockdown gene 
      functions. However, major concerns related to this technique include off-target 
      effects, variations in morpholino efficiency, and potential morpholino toxicity; 
      furthermore, such problems are difficult to discern. Recent advances in genome 
      editing technologies have introduced the prospect of not only generating 
      sequence-specific knockouts, but also providing genome-engineering applications. Two 
      genome editing tools, zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) and transcription activator-like 
      effector nucleases (TALENs), have been utilized in sea urchin embryos, but the 
      resulting efficiencies are far from satisfactory. The CRISPR (clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9 (CRISPR-associated nuclease 9) system 
      serves as an easy and efficient method with which to edit the genomes of several 
      established and emerging model organisms in the field of developmental biology. 
      Here, we apply the CRISPR/Cas9 system to the sea urchin embryo. We designed six 
      guide RNAs (gRNAs) against the well-studied nodal gene and discovered that five of 
      the gRNAs induced the expected phenotype in 60-80% of the injected embryos. In 
      addition, we developed a simple method for isolating genomic DNA from individual 
      embryos, enabling phenotype to be precisely linked to genotype, and revealed that 
      the mutation rates were 67-100% among the sequenced clones. Of the two potential 
      off-target sites we examined, no off-target effects were observed. The detailed 
      procedures described herein promise to accelerate the usage of CRISPR/Cas9 system 
      for genome editing in sea urchin embryos.

AB  - Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a powerful tool to 
      investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), and might 
      provide novel platforms for systematic drug screening. Several strategies have been 
      developed to generate iPSC-derived tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic 
      neurons (DAn), the clinically relevant cell type in PD; however, they often result 
      in mixed neuronal cultures containing only a small proportion of TH-positive DAn. To 
      overcome this limitation, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based editing to generate a human iPSC 
      line expressing a fluorescent protein (mOrange) knocked-in at the last exon of the 
      TH locus. After differentiation of the TH-mOrange reporter iPSC line, we confirmed 
      that mOrange expression faithfully mimicked endogenous TH expression in iPSC-derived 
      DAn. We also employed calcium imaging techniques to determine the intrinsic 
      functional differences between dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic ventral midbrain 
      neurons. Crucially, the brightness of mOrange allowed direct visualization of 
      TH-expressing cells in heterogeneous cultures, and enabled us to isolate live 
      mOrange-positive cells through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, for further 
      differentiation. This technique, coupled to refined imaging and data processing 
      tools, could advance the investigation of PD pathogenesis and might offer a platform 
      to test potential new therapeutics for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The Tribolium castaneum vermilion gene encodes tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, a pivotal 
      enzyme in the ommochrome pathway that is required for proper pigmentation of the 
      eye. A white-eyed mutant strain of T. castaneum, vermilion(white) (v(w)), lacks eye 
      pigmentation due to a deletion of unknown size that removes all but the 3'-end of 
      the vermilion gene. To create a more defined mutation in vermilion, the 
      CRISPR/Cas9-nuclease system was used to target wild type vermilion in preblastoderm 
      T. castaneum embryos. As adults, all injected beetles had wild type (black) eye 
      pigmentation; however, when outcrossed to v(w) mates, one cross produced 19% 
      white-eyed offspring. When the vermilion locus of these offspring was analyzed by 
      target-site sequencing, it was determined that white-eyed individuals had a 2 bp 
      deletion that resulted in a frame-shift mutation, presumably producing a 
      nonfunctional enzyme. Interestingly, some of their black-eyed siblings also had a 
      small deletion of 6 bp, but the resultant loss of two amino acids had no apparent 
      impact on enzyme function. To establish a mutant strain homozygous for the 
      CRISPR-induced knock-out allele, a CRISPR positive G(0) male was crossed to wild 
      type females. Their progeny were self-crossed, and white-eyed progeny were used to 
      establish the new strain. This mutant strain is herein named vermilion(ICE) and will 
      be used in future work in addition to or in place of v(w).

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses a large number of genes of unknown or predicted 
      function, undermining fundamental understanding of pathogenicity and drug 
      susceptibility. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput functional 
      genomics approach combining inducible CRISPR-interference and image-based analyses 
      of morphological features and sub-cellular chromosomal localizations in the related 
      non-pathogen, M. smegmatis. Applying automated imaging and analysis to 263 essential 
      gene knockdown mutants in an arrayed library, we derive robust, quantitative 
      descriptions of bacillary morphologies consequent on gene silencing. Leveraging 
      statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by 
      morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to inform 
      investigations of gene function. Exploiting this observation, we infer the existence 
      of a mycobacterial restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a 
      defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation. Our results support the 
      application of large-scale image-based analyses for mycobacterial functional 
      genomics, simultaneously establishing the utility of this approach for drug 
      mechanism-of-action studies.

OAB - Caused by the microorganism Mycobacterium tuberculosis, tuberculosis kills more 
      people around the world than any other infectious disease. M. tuberculosis is also 
      becoming increasingly resistant to treatments, which are particularly difficult for 
      patients to complete. The M. tuberculosis genome carries about four thousand genes, 
      with several hundred being vital for survival. Finding new ways to fight 
      tuberculosis relies on understanding the exact role of these essential genes, but 
      they are difficult to study in living bacteria. To investigate this question, de Wet 
      et al. used the related, fast-dividing bacterial species called M. smegmatis as a 
      model. Microscopic imaging was combined with CRISPR-interference – a method that 
      temporarily disrupts expression of a specific gene – to examine how blocking an 
      essential gene would affect the shape of the living microorganism. Experiments were 
      conducted on a collection of 270 mutants, capturing single-cell data for hundreds of 
      thousands of live bacteria. To analyze the data, a computational pipeline was built, 
      which automatically clustered similar-shaped bacteria. These groups, or 
      ‘phenoprints’, brought together genes of known and unknown roles; this indicated 
      that these genes participate in similar biological networks – and, if unknown, 
      hinted at their function. Finally, targeting essential genes with 
      CRISPR-interference often yielded the same shape changes as blocking their encoded 
      proteins with antibiotics. This suggests that phenoprints could be useful to 
      understand the mode of action of potential new tuberculosis treatments. When applied 
      to M. tuberculosis and other deadly bacteria, the approach developed by de Wet et 
      al. might speed up drug development.

TI  - Gene silencing of BnaA09.ZEP and BnaC09.ZEP confers orange color in Brassica napus 
      flowers.
PG  - 932-949
LID - 10.1111/tpj.14970 [doi]
AB  - Brassica napus is currently cultivated as an important ornamental crop in China. 
      Flower color has attracted much attention in rapeseed genetics and breeding. Here, 
      we characterize an orange-flowered mutant of B. napus that exhibits an altered 
      carotenoid profile in its petals. As revealed by map-based cloning, the change in 
      color from yellow to orange is attributed to the loss of BnaC09.ZEP (zeaxanthin 
      epoxidase) and a 1695-bp deletion in BnaA09.ZEP. HPLC analysis, genetic 
      complementation and CRISPR/Cas9 experiments demonstrated that BnaA09.ZEP and 
      BnaC09.ZEP have similar functions, and the abolishment of both genes led to a 
      substantial increase in lutein content and a sharp decline in violaxanthin content 
      in petals but not leaves. BnaA09.ZEP and BnaC09.ZEP are predominantly expressed in 
      floral tissues, whereas their homologs, BnaA07.ZEP and BnaC07.ZEP, mainly function 
      in leaves, indicating redundancy and tissue-specific diversification of BnaZEP 
      function. Transcriptome analysis in petals revealed differences in the expression of 
      carotenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis-related genes between the mutant and its 
      complementary lines. Flavonoid profiles in the petals of complementary lines were 
      greatly altered compared to the mutant, indicating potential cross-talk between the 
      regulatory networks underlying the carotenoid and flavonoid pathways. Additionally, 
      our results indicate that there is functional compensation by BnaA07.ZEP and 
      BnaC07.ZEP in the absence of BnaA09.ZEP and BnaC09.ZEP. Cloning and characterization 
      of BnaZEPs provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying flower 
      pigmentation in B. napus and would facilitate breeding of B. napus varieties with 
      higher ornamental value.

TI  - HOXA10 co-factor MEIS1 is required for the decidualization in human endometrial 
      stromal cell.
PG  - 249-258

AB  - Decidualization is a critical process for embryo implantation and pregnancy 
      maintenance in humans. The homeobox gene HOXA10 has been widely studied in 
      endometrial receptivity establishment and decidualization. MEIS1, a three-amino-acid 
      loop extension (TALE) family homeobox gene, has been proven to be a co-factor for 
      HOXA10 in mouse uterus. However, the interaction between MEIS1 and HOXA10 in the 
      human decidual cells remains to be elucidated. siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 were employed 
      to knockdown and knockout MEIS1 in the cultured human endometrial stromal cells, and 
      it was found that MEIS1 deficiency leads to impaired decidualization. The physical 
      interaction between the MEIS1 and HOXA10 in human endometrial stromal cell was 
      confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Moreover, KAT2B and ETA were proved to be 
      downregulated in the absence of MEIS1, and luciferase reporter and ChIP assays 
      demonstrated that MEIS1-HOXA10 complex binds to the promoters of KAT2B and ETA and 
      regulates their activity. Overexpression of KAT2B and ETA can partially rescue the 
      decidualization defects in MEIS1-knockout HESCs. Taken together, these data suggest 
      that MEIS1 plays an indispensable role in decidualization in human endometrial 
      stromal cells, and MEIS1 interacts with HOXA10 to regulate the downstream genes, 
      such as KAT2B and ETA. These findings will contribute to our understanding about the 
      regulatory network in the process of decidualization in humans.

AB  - Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knock out screens provide a valuable addition to the methods 
      available for novel drug target identification and validation. However, where gene 
      editing is targeted to amplified loci, the resulting multiple DNA cleavage events 
      can be a cause of false positive hit identification. The generation of nuclease 
      deficient versions of Cas9 has enabled the development of two additional techniques 
      - CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) - that enable the 
      repression or overexpression, respectively, of target genes. Here we report the 
      first direct combination of all three approaches (CRISPRko, CRISPRi and CRISPRa) in 
      the context of genome-wide screens to identify components that influence resistance 
      and sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib. The pairing of both loss- and 
      gain-of-function datasets reveals complex gene networks which control drug response 
      and illustrates how such data can add substantial confidence to target 
      identification and validation analyses.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 has been successfully adapted for gene editing in malaria parasites 
      including Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii. However, the reported methods 
      were limited to editing one gene at a time. In practice, it is often desired to 
      modify multiple genetic loci in a parasite genome. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 
      mediated genome editing method that allows successive modification of more than one 
      gene in the genome of P. yoelii using an improved single-vector system (pYCm) we 
      developed previously. Drug resistant genes encoding human dihydrofolate reductase 
      (hDHFR) and a yeast bifunctional protein (yFCU), with cytosine deaminase (CD) and 
      uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT) activities in the plasmid, allowed 
      sequential positive (pyrimethamine, Pyr) and negative (5-fluorocytosine, 5FC) 
      selections and generation of transgenic parasites free of the episomal plasmid after 
      genetic modification. Using this system, we were able to efficiently tag a gene of 
      interest (Pyp28) and subsequently disrupted two genes (Pyctrp and Pycdpk3) that are 
      individually critical for ookinete motility. Disruption of the genes either 
      eliminated (Pyctrp) or greatly reduced (Pycdpk3) ookinete forward motility in 
      matrigel in vitro and completely blocked oocyst development in mosquito midgut. The 
      method will greatly facilitate studies of parasite gene function, development, and 
      disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formation by cancer cells is known to play a crucial role 
      in tumor progression, but its detailed mechanism is unclear. In the present study, 
      we focused on integrin β1 (ITGB1) and assessed the role of ITGB1 in VM formation. We 
      used in vitro methods to seed cancer cells on Matrigel to evaluate the capability of 
      VM formation. We carried out ITGB1 gene deletion using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and 
      these ITGB1-knockout cells did not show a VM-like network formation. Further, 
      reintroduction of ITGB1 rescued VM-like network formation in ITGB1-knockout cells. 
      In conclusion, ITGB1 is a critical factor in VM of human cancer cells, and 
      inhibition of ITGB1 may be a novel therapeutic approach for malignant cancer.

      and degeneration. Tissue engineering strategies focused on the restoration of the 
      transitional complexity found in those junctions present special relevance for 
      regenerative medicine. Herein, we developed a gelatin-based multiphasic hydrogel 
      system, where sections with distinct composition and microstructure were integrated 
      in a single unit. In each phase, hydroxyapatite particles or cellulose nanocrystals 
      (CNC) were incorporated into an enzymatically cross-linked gelatin network to mimic 
      bone or tendon tissue, respectively. Stiffer hydrogels were produced with the 
      incorporation of mineralized particles, and magnetic alignment of CNC resulted in 
      anisotropic structure formation. The evaluation of the biological commitment with 
      human adipose-derived stem cells toward the tendon-to-bone interface revealed an 
      aligned cell growth and higher synthesis and deposition of tenascin in the 
      anisotropic phase, while the activity of the secreted alkaline phosphatase and the 
      expression of osteopontin were induced in the mineralized phase. These results 
      highlight the potential versatility offered by gelatin-transglutaminase enzyme 
      tandem for the development of strategies that mimic the graded, composite, and 
      complex intersections of the connective tissues.

AB  - Heart failure is the major cause of death for muscular dystrophy patients, however, 
      the molecular pathomechanism remains unknown. Here, we show the detailed molecular 
      pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy in mice lacking the 
      fukutin gene (Fktn), the causative gene for Fukuyama muscular dystrophy. Although 
      cardiac Fktn elimination markedly reduced α-dystroglycan glycosylation and 
      dystrophin-glycoprotein complex proteins in sarcolemma at all developmental stages, 
      cardiac dysfunction was observed only in later adulthood, suggesting that membrane 
      fragility is not the sole etiology of cardiac dysfunction. During young adulthood, 
      Fktn-deficient mice were vulnerable to pathological hypertrophic stress with 
      downregulation of Akt and the MEF2-histone deacetylase axis. Acute Fktn elimination 
      caused severe cardiac dysfunction and accelerated mortality with myocyte contractile 
      dysfunction and disordered Golgi-microtubule networks, which were ameliorated with 
      colchicine treatment. These data reveal fukutin is crucial for maintaining myocyte 
      physiology to prevent heart failure, and thus, the results may lead to strategies 
      for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Our previous study identified a tag single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs204900 in 
      TNXB associated with risk of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the 
      Chinese population. However, the functional role of TNXB and causal variants had not 
      been interrogated in that study. In the present study, we explored the effects of 
      TNXB expression in the development of ESCC and searched for functional variants in 
      this gene. We found TNXB was downregulated in ESCC tumors. Using small interfering 
      RNAs and CRISPR-Cas9 methods, we identified that both knockdown and knockout of TNXB 
      significantly promoted ESCC cell growth in vitro, suggesting a tumor suppressor role 
      of this gene in ESCC. Through further fine-mapping analysis, we identified that a 
      noncoding variant in the promoter of TNXB, rs411337, predisposed to ESCC risk (odds 
      ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-1.51, P = 9.10 × 10(-9) ). These 
      findings revealed the functional mechanism of TNXB in the development of ESCC and 
      may contribute to the prevention and treatment of this disease in the future.

TI  - Nitrogen Signaling Genes and SOC1 Determine the Flowering Time in a Reciprocal 
      Negative Feedback Loop in Chinese Cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) Based on 
      CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Mutagenesis of Multiple BrSOC1 Homologs.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22094631 [doi]

AB  - Precise flowering timing is critical for the plant life cycle. Here, we examined the 
      molecular mechanisms and regulatory network associated with flowering in Chinese 
      cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) by comparative transcriptome profiling of two Chinese 
      cabbage inbred lines, "4004" (early bolting) and "50" (late bolting). RNA-Seq and 
      quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR) analyses showed that two positive 
      nitric oxide (NO) signaling regulator genes, nitrite reductase (BrNIR) and nitrate 
      reductase (BrNIA), were up-regulated in line "50" with or without vernalization. In 
      agreement with the transcription analysis, the shoots in line "50" had substantially 
      higher nitrogen levels than those in "4004". Upon vernalization, the flowering 
      repressor gene Circadian 1 (BrCIR1) was significantly up-regulated in line "50", 
      whereas the flowering enhancer genes named SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANCE 
      1 homologs (BrSOC1s) were substantially up-regulated in line "4004". 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in Chinese cabbage demonstrated that the 
      BrSOC1-1/1-2/1-3 genes were involved in late flowering, and their expression was 
      mutually exclusive with that of the nitrogen signaling genes. Thus, we identified 
      two flowering mechanisms in Chinese cabbage: a reciprocal negative feedback loop 
      between nitrogen signaling genes (BrNIA1 and BrNIR1) and BrSOC1s to control 
      flowering time and positive feedback control of the expression of BrSOC1s.

AB  - Dravet syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy largely due to haploinsufficiency of 
      the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 that is expressed primarily in GABAergic 
      neurons. In order to distinguish the different subtypes, we used gene editing to 
      introduce tdTomato gene into the genome of iPSCs to label the GABAergic neurons in 
      the differentiated neuronal networks. The gene-edited cell line demonstrates normal 
      karyotype, expresses the main pluripotency markers, and shows the presence of 
      differentiation into the three embryonic germ layers in teratomas.

TI  - Improved bioethanol production using CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt the ADH2 gene in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 154

AB  - Bioethanol, as a form of renewable and clean energy, has become increasingly 
      important to the energy supply. One major obstacle in ethanol production is 
      developing a high-capacity system. Existing approaches for regulating the ethanol 
      production pathway are relatively insufficient, with nonspecific genetic 
      manipulation. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to disrupt the alcohol 
      dehydrogenase (ADH) 2 gene via complete deletion of the gene and introduction of a 
      frameshift mutation in the ADH2 locus. Sequencing demonstrated the accurate knockout 
      of the target gene with 91.4% and near 100% targeting efficiency. We also utilized 
      genome resequencing to validate the mutations in the ADH2 mutants targeted by 
      various single-guide RNAs. This extensive analysis indicated the mutations in the 
      CRISPR/Cas9-engineered strains were homozygous. We applied the engineered 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for bioethanol production. Results showed that the 
      ethanol yield improved by up to 74.7% compared with the yield obtained using the 
      native strain. This work illustrates the applicability of this highly efficient and 
      specific genome engineering approach to promote the improvement of bioethanol 
      production in S. cerevisiae via metabolic engineering. Importantly, this study is 
      the first report of the disruption of a target gene, ADH2, in S. cerevisiae using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology to improve bioethanol yield.

AB  - Many metabolic liver disorders are refractory to drug therapy and require orthotopic 
      liver transplantation. Here we demonstrate a new strategy, which we call metabolic 
      pathway reprogramming, to treat hereditary tyrosinaemia type I in mice; rather than 
      edit the disease-causing gene, we delete a gene in a disease-associated pathway to 
      render the phenotype benign. Using CRISPR/Cas9 in vivo, we convert hepatocytes from 
      tyrosinaemia type I into the benign tyrosinaemia type III by deleting Hpd 
      (hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxigenase). Edited hepatocytes (Fah(-/-)/Hpd(-/-)) display 
      a growth advantage over non-edited hepatocytes (Fah(-/-)/Hpd(+/+)) and, in some 
      mice, almost completely replace them within 8 weeks. Hpd excision successfully 
      reroutes tyrosine catabolism, leaving treated mice healthy and asymptomatic. 
      Metabolic pathway reprogramming sidesteps potential difficulties associated with 
      editing a critical disease-causing gene and can be explored as an option for 
      treating other diseases.

TI  - RNA editing-mediated regulation of calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 
      (CAPS1) localization and its impact on synaptic transmission.
PG  - 182-196
LID - 10.1111/jnc.15372 [doi]
AB  - Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1) is a SNARE accessory 
      protein that facilitates formation of the SNARE complex to enable neurotransmitter 
      release. Messenger RNAs encoding CAPS1 are subject to a site-specific 
      adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing event resulting in a glutamate-to-glycine 
      (E-to-G) substitution in the C-terminal domain of the encoded protein product. The 
      C-terminal domain of CAPS1 is necessary for its synaptic enrichment and Cadps RNA 
      editing has been shown previously to enhance the release of neuromodulatory 
      transmitters. Using mutant mouse lines engineered to solely express CAPS1 protein 
      isoforms encoded by either the non-edited or edited Cadps transcript, primary 
      neuronal cultures from mouse hippocampus were used to explore the effect of Cadps 
      editing on neurotransmission and CAPS1 synaptic localization at both glutamatergic 
      and GABAergic synapses. While the editing of Cadps does not alter baseline evoked 
      neurotransmission, it enhances short-term synaptic plasticity, specifically 
      short-term depression, at inhibitory synapses. Cadps editing also alters spontaneous 
      inhibitory neurotransmission. Neurons that solely express edited Cadps have a 
      greater proportion of synapses that contain CAPS1 than neurons that solely express 
      non-edited Cadps for both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Editing of Cadps 
      transcripts is regulated by neuronal activity, as global network stimulation 
      increases the extent of transcripts edited in wild-type hippocampal neurons, whereas 
      chronic network silencing decreases the level of Cadps editing. Taken together, 
      these results provide key insights into the importance of Cadps editing in 
      modulating its own synaptic localization, as well as the modulation of 
      neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons.

TI  - Recursive DNA Assembly Using Protected Oligonucleotide Duplex Assisted Cloning 
      (PODAC).
PG  - 943-949
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00017 [doi]
AB  - A problem rarely tackled by current DNA assembly methods is the issue of cloning 
      additional parts into an already assembled construct. Costly PCR workflows are often 
      hindered by repeated sequences, and restriction based strategies impose design 
      constraints for each enzyme used. Here we present Protected Oligonucleotide Duplex 
      Assisted Cloning (PODAC), a novel technique that makes use of an oligonucleotide 
      duplex for iterative Golden Gate cloning using only one restriction enzyme. 
      Methylated bases confer protection from digestion during the assembly reaction and 
      are removed during replication in vivo, unveiling a new cloning site in the process. 
      We used this method to efficiently and accurately assemble a biosynthetic pathway 
      and demonstrated its robustness toward sequence repeats by constructing artificial 
      CRISPR arrays. As PODAC is readily amenable to standardization, it would make a 
      useful addition to the synthetic biology toolkit.

TI  - netprioR: a probabilistic model for integrative hit prioritisation of genetic 
      screens.
LID - 10.1515/sagmb-2018-0033 [doi]
AB  - In the post-genomic era of big data in biology, computational approaches to 
      integrate multiple heterogeneous data sets become increasingly important. Despite 
      the availability of large amounts of omics data, the prioritisation of genes 
      relevant for a specific functional pathway based on genetic screening experiments, 
      remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce netprioR, a probabilistic generative 
      model for semi-supervised integrative prioritisation of hit genes. The model 
      integrates multiple network data sets representing gene-gene similarities and prior 
      knowledge about gene functions from the literature with gene-based covariates, such 
      as phenotypes measured in genetic perturbation screens, for example, by RNA 
      interference or CRISPR/Cas9. We evaluate netprioR on simulated data and show that 
      the model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in many scenarios and is on 
      par otherwise. In an application to real biological data, we integrate 22 network 
      data sets, 1784 prior knowledge class labels and 3840 RNA interference phenotypes in 
      order to prioritise novel regulators of Notch signalling in Drosophila melanogaster. 
      The biological relevance of our predictions is evaluated using in silico and in vivo 
      experiments. An efficient implementation of netprioR is available as an R package at 
      http://bioconductor.org/packages/netprioR.

TI  - A disorder-related variant (E420K) of a PP2A-regulatory subunit (PPP2R5D) causes 
      constitutively active AKT-mTOR signaling and uncoordinated cell growth.

AB  - Functional genomic approaches have facilitated the discovery of rare genetic 
      disorders and improved efforts to decipher their underlying etiology. 
      PPP2R5D-related disorder is an early childhood onset condition characterized by 
      intellectual disability, hypotonia, autism-spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, and 
      dysmorphic features. The disorder is caused by de novo single nucleotide changes in 
      PPP2R5D, which generate heterozygous dominant missense variants. PPP2R5D is known to 
      encode a B'-type (B'56δ) regulatory subunit of a PP2A-serine/threonine phosphatase. 
      To help elucidate the molecular mechanisms altered in PPP2R5D-related disorder, we 
      used a CRISPR-single-base editor to generate HEK-293 cells in which a single 
      transition (c.1258G>A) was introduced into one allele, precisely recapitulating a 
      clinically relevant E420K variant. Unbiased quantitative proteomic and 
      phosphoproteomic analyses of endogenously expressed proteins revealed 
      heterozygous-dominant changes in kinase/phosphatase signaling. These data combined 
      with orthogonal validation studies revealed a previously unrecognized interaction of 
      PPP2R5D with AKT in human cells, leading to constitutively active AKT-mTOR 
      signaling, increased cell size, and uncoordinated cellular growth in E420K-variant 
      cells. Rapamycin reduced cell size and dose-dependently reduced RPS6 phosphorylation 
      in E420K-variant cells, suggesting that inhibition of mTOR1 can suppress both the 
      observed RPS6 hyperphosphorylation and increased cell size. Together, our findings 
      provide a deeper understanding of PPP2R5D and insight into how the E420K-variant 
      alters signaling networks influenced by PPP2R5D. Our comprehensive approach, which 
      combines precise genome editing, isobaric tandem mass tag labeling of peptides 
      generated from endogenously expressed proteins, and concurrent liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS(3)), also provides a roadmap that can be 
      used to rapidly explore the etiologies of additional genetic disorders.

TI  - Genome editing of model oleaginous microalgae Nannochloropsis spp. by CRISPR/Cas9.
PG  - 1071-1081
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13307 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae are promising feedstock for biofuels yet mechanistic probing of their 
      cellular network and industrial strain development have been hindered by lack of 
      genome-editing tools. Nannochloropsis spp. are emerging model microalgae for 
      scalable oil production and carbon sequestration. Here we established a 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based precise genome-editing approach for the industrial oleaginous 
      microalga Nannochloropsis oceanica, using nitrate reductase (NR; g7988) as example. 
      A new screening procedure that compares between restriction enzyme-digested nested 
      PCR (nPCR) products derived from enzyme-digested and not-digested genomic DNA of 
      transformant pools was developed to quickly, yet reliably, detect genome-engineered 
      mutants. Deep sequencing of nPCR products directly amplified from pooled genomic DNA 
      revealed over an 1% proportion of 5-bp deletion mutants and a lower frequency of 
      12-bp deletion mutants, with both types of editing precisely located at the targeted 
      site. The isolated mutants, in which precise deletion of five bases caused a 
      frameshift in NR translation, grow normally under NH(4) Cl but fail to grow under 
      NaNO(3) , and thus represent a valuable chassis strain for transgenic-strain 
      development. This demonstration of CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing in industrial 
      microalgae opens many doors for microalgae-based biotechnological applications.

TI  - Redirecting Metabolic Flux via Combinatorial Multiplex CRISPRi-Mediated Repression 
      for Isopentenol Production in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 391-402
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.8b00429 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) via target guide RNA (gRNA) arrays and a deactivated 
      Cas9 (dCas9) protein has been shown to simultaneously repress expression of multiple 
      genomic DNA loci. By knocking down endogenous genes in competing pathways, CRISPRi 
      technology can be utilized to redirect metabolic flux toward target metabolite. In 
      this study, we constructed a CRISPRi-mediated multiplex repression system to silence 
      transcription of several endogenous genes to increase precursor availability in a 
      heterologous isopentenol biosynthesis pathway. To identify genomic knockdown targets 
      in competing pathways, we first designed a single-gRNA library with 15 individual 
      targets, where 3 gRNA cassettes targeting gene asnA, prpE, and gldA increased 
      isopentenol titer by 18-24%. We then combined the 3 single-gRNA cassettes into a 
      two- or three-gRNA array and observed up to 98% enhancement in production by 
      fine-tuning the repression level through titrating dCas9 expression. Our strategy 
      shows that multiplex combinatorial knockdown of competing genes using CRISPRi can 
      increase production of the target metabolite, while the repression level needs to be 
      adjusted to balance the metabolic network and achieve the maximum titer improvement.

TI  - Genome sequence of the model sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio gigas: a comparative 
      analysis within the Desulfovibrio genus.
PG  - 513-30
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.184 [doi]
AB  - Desulfovibrio gigas is a model organism of sulfate-reducing bacteria of which energy 
      metabolism and stress response have been extensively studied. The complete genomic 
      context of this organism was however, not yet available. The sequencing of the D. 
      gigas genome provides insights into the integrated network of energy conserving 
      complexes and structures present in this bacterium. Comparison with genomes of other 
      Desulfovibrio spp. reveals the presence of two different CRISPR/Cas systems in D. 
      gigas. Phylogenetic analysis using conserved protein sequences (encoded by rpoB and 
      gyrB) indicates two main groups of Desulfovibrio spp, being D. gigas more closely 
      related to D. vulgaris and D. desulfuricans strains. Gene duplications were found 
      such as those encoding fumarate reductase, formate dehydrogenase, and superoxide 
      dismutase. Complexes not yet described within Desulfovibrio genus were identified: 
      Mnh complex, a v-type ATP-synthase as well as genes encoding the MinCDE system that 
      could be responsible for the larger size of D. gigas when compared to other members 
      of the genus. A low number of hydrogenases and the absence of the codh/acs and pfl 
      genes, both present in D. vulgaris strains, indicate that intermediate cycling 
      mechanisms may contribute substantially less to the energy gain in D. gigas compared 
      to other Desulfovibrio spp. This might be compensated by the presence of other 
      unique genomic arrangements of complexes such as the Rnf and the Hdr/Flox, or by the 
      presence of NAD(P)H related complexes, like the Nuo, NfnAB or Mnh.

TI  - A CRISPR/Cas9-based exploration into the elusive mechanism for lactate export in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - 10.1093/femsyr/fox085 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing allows rapid, simultaneous modification of multiple 
      genetic loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, this technique was used in a 
      functional analysis study aimed at identifying the hitherto unknown mechanism of 
      lactate export in this yeast. First, an S. cerevisiae strain was constructed with 
      deletions in 25 genes encoding transport proteins, including the complete 
      aqua(glycero)porin family and all known carboxylic acid transporters. The 
      25-deletion strain was then transformed with an expression cassette for 
      Lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenase (LcLDH). In anaerobic, glucose-grown batch 
      cultures this strain exhibited a lower specific growth rate (0.15 vs. 0.25 h-1) and 
      biomass-specific lactate production rate (0.7 vs. 2.4 mmol g biomass-1 h-1) than an 
      LcLDH-expressing reference strain. However, a comparison of the two strains in 
      anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures (dilution rate 0.10 h-1) showed 
      identical lactate production rates. These results indicate that, although deletion 
      of the 25 transporter genes affected the maximum specific growth rate, it did not 
      impact lactate export rates when analysed at a fixed specific growth rate. The 
      25-deletion strain provides a first step towards a 'minimal transportome' yeast 
      platform, which can be applied for functional analysis of specific (heterologous) 
      transport proteins as well as for evaluation of metabolic engineering strategies.

TI  - piRNAs derived from ancient viral processed pseudogenes as transgenerational 
      sequence-specific immune memory in mammals.
PG  - 1691-703
LID - 10.1261/rna.052092.115 [doi]
AB  - Endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoprotein elements (EBLNs) are sequences within 
      vertebrate genomes derived from reverse transcription and integration of ancient 
      bornaviral nucleoprotein mRNA via the host retrotransposon machinery. While species 
      with EBLNs appear relatively resistant to bornaviral disease, the nature of this 
      association is unclear. We hypothesized that EBLNs could give rise to antiviral 
      interfering RNA in the form of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small RNA 
      known to silence transposons but not exogenous viruses. We found that in both 
      rodents and primates, which acquired their EBLNs independently some 25-40 million 
      years ago, EBLNs are present within piRNA-generating regions of the genome far more 
      often than expected by chance alone (ℙ = 8 × 10(-3)-6 × 10(-8)). Three of the seven 
      human EBLNs fall within annotated piRNA clusters and two marmoset EBLNs give rise to 
      bona fide piRNAs. In both rats and mice, at least two of the five EBLNs give rise to 
      abundant piRNAs in the male gonad. While no EBLNs are syntenic between rodent and 
      primate, some of the piRNA clusters containing EBLNs are; thus we deduce that EBLNs 
      were integrated into existing piRNA clusters. All true piRNAs derived from EBLNs are 
      antisense relative to the proposed ancient bornaviral nucleoprotein mRNA. These 
      observations are consistent with a role for EBLN-derived piRNA-like RNAs in 
      interfering with ancient bornaviral infection. They raise the hypothesis that 
      retrotransposon-dependent virus-to-host gene flow could engender RNA-mediated, 
      sequence-specific antiviral immune memory in metazoans analogous to the CRISPR/Cas 
      system in prokaryotes.

AB  - Despite the utility of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases for genome editing, the potential for 
      off-target activity limits their application, especially for therapeutic purposes. 
      We developed a yeast-based assay to identify optimized Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 
      (SpCas9) variants that enables simultaneous evaluation of on- and off-target 
      activity. We screened a library of SpCas9 variants carrying random mutations in the 
      REC3 domain and identified mutations that increased editing accuracy while 
      maintaining editing efficiency. We combined four beneficial mutations to generate 
      evoCas9, a variant that has fidelity exceeding both wild-type (79-fold improvement) 
      and rationally designed Cas9 variants (fourfold average improvement), while 
      maintaining near wild-type on-target editing efficiency (90% median residual 
      activity). Evaluating evoCas9 on endogenous genomic loci, we demonstrated a 
      substantially improved specificity and observed no off-target sites for four of the 
      eight single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested. Finally, we showed that following long-term 
      expression (40 d), evoCas9 strongly limited the nonspecific cleavage of a 
      difficult-to-discriminate off-target site and fully abrogated the cleavage of two 
      additional off-target sites.

AB  - Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the preferred host for producing 
      biopharmaceuticals. Amino acids are biologically important precursors for CHO 
      metabolism; they serve as building blocks for proteogenesis, including synthesis of 
      biomass and recombinant proteins, and are utilized for growth and cellular 
      maintenance. In this work, we studied the physiological impact of disrupting a range 
      of amino acid catabolic pathways in CHO cells. We aimed to reduce secretion of 
      growth inhibiting metabolic by-products derived from amino acid catabolism including 
      lactate and ammonium. To achieve this, we engineered nine genes in seven different 
      amino acid catabolic pathways using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system. For 
      identification of target genes, we used a metabolic network reconstruction of amino 
      acid catabolism to follow transcriptional changes in response to antibody 
      production, which revealed candidate genes for disruption. We found that disruption 
      of single amino acid catabolic genes reduced specific lactate and ammonium secretion 
      while specific growth rate and integral of viable cell density were increased in 
      many cases. Of particular interest were Hpd and Gad2 disruptions, which show 
      unchanged AA uptake rates, while having growth rates increased up to 19%, and 
      integral of viable cell density as much as 50% higher, and up to 26% decrease in 
      specific ammonium production and to a lesser extent (up to 22%) decrease in lactate 
      production. This study demonstrates the broad potential of engineering amino acid 
      catabolism in CHO cells to achieve improved phenotypes for bioprocessing.

      for editing protein-RNA interaction sites in the human genome.

AB  - Several protein-RNA cross linking protocols have been established in recent years to 
      delineate the molecular interaction of an RNA Binding Protein (RBP) and its target 
      RNAs. However, functional dissection of the role of the RBP binding sites in 
      modulating the post-transcriptional fate of the target RNA remains challenging. 
      CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system is being commonly employed to perturb both coding 
      and noncoding regions in the genome. With the advancements in genome-scale 
      CRISPR/Cas9 screens, it is now possible to not only perturb specific binding sites 
      but also probe the global impact of protein-RNA interaction sites across cell types. 
      Here, we present SliceIt (http://sliceit.soic.iupui.edu/), a database of in silico 
      sgRNA (single guide RNA) library to facilitate conducting such high throughput 
      screens. SliceIt comprises of ~4.8 million unique sgRNAs with an estimated range of 
      2-8 sgRNAs designed per RBP binding site, for eCLIP experiments of >100 RBPs in 
      HepG2 and K562 cell lines from the ENCODE project. SliceIt provides a user friendly 
      environment, developed using advanced search engine framework, Elasticsearch. It is 
      available in both table and genome browser views facilitating the easy navigation of 
      RBP binding sites, designed sgRNAs, exon expression levels across 53 human tissues 
      along with prevalence of SNPs and GWAS hits on binding sites. Exon expression 
      profiles enable examination of locus specific changes proximal to the binding sites. 
      Users can also upload custom tracks of various file formats directly onto genome 
      browser, to navigate additional genomic features in the genome and compare with 
      other types of omics profiles. All the binding site-centric information is 
      dynamically accessible via "search by gene", "search by coordinates" and "search by 
      RBP" options and readily available to download. Validation of the sgRNA library in 
      SliceIt was performed by selecting RBP binding sites in Lipt1 gene and designing 
      sgRNAs. Effect of CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations on the selected binding sites in HepG2 
      cell line, was confirmed based on altered proximal exon expression levels using 
      qPCR, further supporting the utility of the resource to design experiments for 
      perturbing protein-RNA interaction networks. Thus, SliceIt provides a one-stop 
      repertoire of guide RNA library to perturb RBP binding sites, along with several 
      layers of functional information to design both low and high throughput CRISPR/Cas9 
      screens, for studying the phenotypes and diseases associated with RBP binding sites.

TI  - A HOTAIR regulatory element modulates glioma cell sensitivity to temozolomide 
      through long-range regulation of multiple target genes.
PG  - 155-163
LID - 10.1101/gr.251058.119 [doi]
AB  - Temozolomide (TMZ) is a frequently used chemotherapy for glioma; however, 
      chemoresistance is a major problem limiting its effectiveness. Thus, knowledge of 
      mechanisms underlying this outcome could improve patient prognosis. Here, we report 
      that deletion of a regulatory element in the HOTAIR locus increases glioma cell 
      sensitivity to TMZ and alters transcription of multiple genes. Analysis of a 
      combination of RNA-seq, Capture Hi-C, and patient survival data suggests that 
      CALCOCO1 and ZC3H10 are target genes repressed by the HOTAIR regulatory element and 
      that both function in regulating glioma cell sensitivity to TMZ. Rescue experiments 
      and 3C data confirmed this hypothesis. We propose a new regulatory mechanism 
      governing glioma cell TMZ sensitivity.

TI  - Targeted mutagenesis of CYP76AK2 and CYP76AK3 in Salvia miltiorrhiza reveals their 
      roles in tanshinones biosynthetic pathway.

AB  - Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, belonging to Lamiaceae family, is one of the most 
      important Chinese medicinal herbs. The dried roots, also called Danshen in Chinese, 
      are usually used in the formula of Chinese traditional medicine due to the bioactive 
      constituents known as phenolic acids and tanshinones, which are a group of abietane 
      nor-diterpenoid quinone natural products. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) usually 
      play crucial roles in terpenoids synthesis, especially in hydroxylation processes. 
      Up to now, several important P450 enzymes, such as CYP76AH1, CYP76AH3, CYP76AK1, 
      CYP71D373, and CYP71D375, have been functionally characterized in the tanshinones 
      biosynthetic pathway. Nevertheless, the tanshinones biosynthesis is a so complex 
      network that more P450 enzymes should be identified and characterized. Here, we 
      report two novel P450 enzymes CYP76AK2 and CYP76AK3 that are involved in tanshinones 
      biosynthetic pathway. These two P450 enzymes were highly homologous to previously 
      reported CYP76AK1 and showed the same expression profile as CYP76AK1. Also, CYP76AK2 
      and CYP76AK3 could be stimulated by MeJA and SA, resulting in increased expression. 
      We used a triple-target CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate targeted mutagenesis of 
      CYP76AK2 and CYP76AK3 in S. miltiorrhiza. The content of five major tanshinones was 
      significantly reduced in both cyp76ak2 and cyp76ak3 mutants, indicating that the two 
      enzymes might be involved in the biosynthesis of tanshinones. This study would 
      provide a foundation for the catalytic function identification of CYP76AK2 and 
      CYP76AK3, and further enrich the understanding of the network of tanshinones 
      secondary metabolism synthesis as well.

AB  - Efficient biosynthesis of the plant polyphenol pinosylvin, which has numerous 
      applications in nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals, is necessary to make biological 
      production economically viable. To this end, an efficient Escherichia coli platform 
      for pinosylvin production was developed via a rational modular design approach. 
      Initially, different candidate pathway enzymes were screened to construct de novo 
      pinosylvin pathway directly from D-glucose. A comparative analysis of pathway 
      intermediate pools identified that this initial construct led to the intermediate 
      cinnamic acid accumulation. The pinosylvin synthetic pathway was then divided into 
      two new modules separated at cinnamic acid. Combinatorial optimization of 
      transcriptional and translational levels of these two modules resulted in a 16-fold 
      increase in pinosylvin titer. To further improve the concentration of the limiting 
      precursor malonyl-CoA, the malonyl-CoA synthesis module based on clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats interference was assembled and optimized with 
      other two modules. The final pinosylvin titer was improved to 281 mg/L, which was 
      the highest pinosylvin titer even directly from D-glucose without any additional 
      precursor supplementation. The rational modular design approach described here could 
      bolster our capabilities in synthetic biology for value-added chemical production.

LID - 10.1111/1758-2229.12424 [doi]
AB  - Marine prokaryotes have evolved a broad repertoire of defence systems to protect 
      their genomes from lateral gene transfer including innate or acquired immune systems 
      and infection-induced programmed cell suicide and dormancy. Here we report on the 
      analysis of multiple defence systems present in the genome of the strain 
      Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME isolated from petroleum deposits of the tanker 'Amoco 
      Milford Haven'. Cycloclasticus are ubiquitous bacteria globally important in 
      polyaromatic hydrocarbons degradation in marine environments. Two 'defence islands' 
      were identified in 78-ME genome: the first harbouring CRISPR-Cas with 
      toxin-antitoxin system, while the second was composed by an array of genes for 
      toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification proteins. Among all identified spacers 
      of CRISPR-Cas system only seven spacers match sequences of phages and plasmids. 
      Furthermore, a conjugative plasmid p7ME01, which belongs to a new IncP-1θ ancestral 
      archetype without any accessory mobile elements was found in 78-ME. Our results 
      provide the context to the co-occurrence of diverse defence mechanisms in the genome 
      of Cycloclasticus sp. 78-ME, which protect the genome of this highly specialized 
      PAH-degrader. This study contributes to the further understanding of complex 
      networks established in petroleum-based microbial communities.

AB  - Transmembrane signals initiated by a range of extracellular stimuli converge on 
      members of the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, which relay these signals in 
      target cells. Gq family G proteins comprise Gq, G11, G14, and G16, which upon 
      activation mediate their cellular effects via inositol lipid-dependent and 
      -independent signaling to control fundamental processes in mammalian physiology. To 
      date, highly specific inhibition of Gq/11/14 signaling can be achieved only with 
      FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), two naturally occurring cyclic depsipeptides. To 
      further development of FR or YM mimics for other Gα subunits, we here set out to 
      rationally design Gα16 proteins with artificial FR/YM sensitivity by introducing an 
      engineered depsipeptide-binding site. Thereby we permit control of G16 function 
      through ligands that are inactive on the WT protein. Using CRISPR/Cas9-generated 
      Gαq/Gα11-null cells and loss- and gain-of-function mutagenesis along with label-free 
      whole-cell biosensing, we determined the molecular coordinates for FR/YM inhibition 
      of Gq and transplanted these to FR/YM-insensitive G16. Intriguingly, despite having 
      close structural similarity, FR and YM yielded biologically distinct activities: it 
      was more difficult to perturb Gq inhibition by FR and easier to install FR 
      inhibition onto G16 than perturb or install inhibition with YM. A unique hydrophobic 
      network utilized by FR accounted for these unexpected discrepancies. Our results 
      suggest that non-Gq/11/14 proteins should be amenable to inhibition by FR 
      scaffold-based inhibitors, provided that these inhibitors mimic the interaction of 
      FR with Gα proteins harboring engineered FR-binding sites.

AB  - Reducing the incidence of malaria has been a public health priority for nearly a 
      century. New technologies and associated vector control strategies play an important 
      role in the prospect of sustained reductions. The development of the CRISPR/Cas9 
      gene editing system has generated new possibilities for the use of gene-drive 
      constructs to reduce or alter vector populations to reduce malaria incidence. 
      However, before these technologies can be developed and exploited, it will be 
      necessary to understand and assess the likelihood of any potential harms to humans 
      or the environment. To begin this process, the Foundation for the National 
      Institutes of Health and the International Life Sciences Institute Research 
      Foundation organized an expert workshop to consider the potential risks related to 
      the use of gene drives in Anopheles gambiae for malaria control in Africa. The 
      resulting discussion yielded a series of consensus points that are reported here.

TI  - Novel Insights into the Roles of Bcl-2 Homolog Nr-13 (vNr-13) Encoded by Herpesvirus 
      of Turkeys in the Virus Replication Cycle, Mitochondrial Networks, and Apoptosis 
      Inhibition.
LID - 10.1128/JVI.02049-19 [doi]
LID - e02049-19
AB  - The Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma 2)-related protein Nr-13 plays a major role in the 
      regulation of cell death in developing avian B cells. With over 65% sequence 
      similarity to the chicken Nr-13, herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) vNr-13, encoded by the 
      HVT079 and HVT096 genes, is the first known alphaherpesvirus-encoded Bcl-2 homolog. 
      HVT-infected cells were reported to be relatively more resistant to serum 
      starvation, suggested that vNr-13 could be involved in protecting the cells. Here, 
      we describe CRISPR/Cas9-based editing of exon 1 of the HVT079 and HVT096 genes from 
      the HVT genome to generate the mutant HVT-ΔvNr-13 to gain insights into its 
      functional roles. Overall, wild-type HVT and HVT-ΔvNr-13 showed similar growth 
      kinetics; however, at early time points, HVT-ΔvNr-13 showed 1.3- to 1.7-fold-lower 
      growth of cell-associated virus and 3- to 6.2-fold-lower growth of cell-free virus. 
      In transfected cells, HVT vNr-13 showed a mainly diffuse cytoplasmic distribution 
      with faint nuclear staining. Further, vNr-13 localized to the mitochondria and 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and disrupted mitochondrial network morphology in the 
      transfected cells. In the wild-type HVT-infected cells, vNr-13 expression appeared 
      to be directly involved in the disruption of the mitochondrial network, as the 
      mitochondrial network morphology was substantially restored in the 
      HVT-ΔvNr-13-infected cells. IncuCyte S3 real-time apoptosis monitoring demonstrated 
      that vNr-13 is unequivocally involved in the apoptosis inhibition, and it is 
      associated with an increase of PFU, especially under serum-free conditions in the 
      later stages of the viral replication cycle. Furthermore, HVT blocks apoptosis in 
      infected cells but activates apoptosis in noninfected bystander cells.IMPORTANCE B 
      cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins play important roles in regulating apoptosis 
      during homeostasis, tissue development, and infectious diseases. Several viruses 
      encode homologs of cellular Bcl-2-proteins (vBcl-2) to inhibit apoptosis, which 
      enable them to replicate and persist in the infected cells and to evade/modulate the 
      immune response of the host. Herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) is a nonpathogenic 
      alphaherpesvirus of turkeys and chickens that is widely used as a live vaccine 
      against Marek's disease and as recombinant vaccine viral vectors for protecting 
      against multiple avian diseases. Identical copies of the HVT genes HVT079 and HVT096 
      encode the Bcl-2 homolog vNr-13. While previous studies have identified the 
      potential ability of vNr-13 in inhibiting apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, 
      there have been no detailed investigations on the functions of vNr-13. Using 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based ablation of the vNr-13 gene, we demonstrated the roles of HVT 
      vNr-13 in early stages of the viral replication cycle, mitochondrial morphology 
      disruption, and apoptosis inhibition in later stages of viral replication.

AB  - Furin trafficking, and that of related proprotein convertases (PCs), may regulate 
      which substrates are accessible for endoproteolysis, but tools to directly test this 
      hypothesis have been lacking. Here, we develop targeted biosensors that indicate 
      Furin activity in endosomes is 10-fold less inhibited by 
      decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone and enriched >3-fold in endosomes compared to the 
      trans-Golgi network (TGN). Endogenous PC7, which resists this inhibitor, was active 
      in distinct vesicles. Only overexpressed PC7 activity reached the cell surface, 
      endosomes, and the TGN. A PLC motif in the cytosolic tail of PC7 was dispensable for 
      endosomal activity, but it was specifically required for TGN recycling and to rescue 
      proActivin-A cleavage in Furin-depleted B16F1 melanoma cells. In sharp contrast, PC7 
      complemented Furin in cleaving Notch1 independently of PLC-mediated TGN access. Our 
      study provides a proof in principle that compartment-specific biosensors can be used 
      to gain insight into the regulation of PC trafficking and to map the tropism of 
      PC-specific inhibitors.

TI  - Human PRPF40B regulates hundreds of alternative splicing targets and represses a 
      hypoxia expression signature.
PG  - 905-920
LID - 10.1261/rna.069534.118 [doi]
AB  - Altered splicing contributes to the pathogenesis of human blood disorders including 
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and leukemias. Here we characterize the 
      transcriptomic regulation of PRPF40B, which is a splicing factor mutated in a small 
      fraction of MDS patients. We generated a full PRPF40B knockout (KO) in the K562 cell 
      line by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and rescued its levels by transient overexpression of 
      wild-type (WT), P383L or P540S MDS alleles. Using RNA sequencing, we identified 
      hundreds of differentially expressed genes and alternative splicing (AS) events in 
      the KO that are rescued by WT PRPF40B, with a majority also rescued by MDS alleles, 
      pointing to mild effects of these mutations. Among the PRPF40B-regulated AS events, 
      we found a net increase in exon inclusion in the KO, suggesting that this splicing 
      factor primarily acts as a repressor. PRPF40B-regulated splicing events are likely 
      cotranscriptional, affecting exons with A-rich downstream intronic motifs and weak 
      splice sites especially for 5' splice sites, consistent with its PRP40 yeast 
      ortholog being part of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. Loss of PRPF40B in 
      K562 induces a KLF1 transcriptional signature, with genes involved in iron 
      metabolism and mainly hypoxia, including related pathways like cholesterol 
      biosynthesis and Akt/MAPK signaling. A cancer database analysis revealed that 
      PRPF40B is lowly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, whereas its paralog PRPF40A 
      expression is high as opposed to solid tumors. Furthermore, these factors negatively 
      or positively correlated with hypoxia regulator HIF1A, respectively. Our data 
      suggest a PRPF40B role in repressing hypoxia in myeloid cells, and that its low 
      expression might contribute to leukemogenesis.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying enhancer activation and the extent to which 
      enhancer-promoter rewiring contributes to spatiotemporal gene expression are not 
      well understood. Using integrative and time-resolved analyses we show that the 
      extensive transcriptome and epigenome resetting during the conversion between 
      'serum' and '2i' states of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) takes place with 
      minimal enhancer-promoter rewiring that becomes more evident in primed-state 
      pluripotency. Instead, differential gene expression is strongly linked to enhancer 
      activation via H3K27ac. Conditional depletion of transcription factors and 
      allele-specific enhancer analysis reveal an essential role for Esrrb in H3K27 
      acetylation and activation of 2i-specific enhancers. Restoration of a polymorphic 
      ESRRB motif using CRISPR-Cas9 in a hybrid ESC line restores ESRRB binding and 
      enhancer H3K27ac in an allele-specific manner but has no effect on chromatin 
      interactions. Our study shows that enhancer activation in serum- and 2i-ESCs is 
      largely driven by transcription factor binding and epigenetic marking in a hardwired 
      network of chromatin interactions.

AB  - OCT4 is a crucial transcription factor in the pluripotent stem cell gene regulatory 
      network and an essential factor for pluripotent reprogramming. We engineered the 
      previously reported HEL24.3 hiPSC to generate an OCT4 reporter cell line by 
      knocking-in a T2A nuclear EmGFP reporter cassette before the OCT4 gene STOP codon 
      sequence. To enhance targeted insertion, homologous recombination was stimulated 
      using targeted cutting at the OCT4 STOP codon with CRISPR/SpCas9. This 
      HEL24.3-OCT4-nEmGFP cell line faithfully reports endogenous OCT4 expression, serving 
      as a useful tool to examine temporal changes in OCT4 expression in live cells during 
      hiPSC culture, differentiation and somatic cell reprogramming.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Intersectional Knockout of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β in D2 
      Receptor-Expressing Medial Prefrontal Cortex Neurons Reveals Contributions to 
      Emotional Regulation.
PG  - 198-210
LID - 10.1089/crispr.2019.0075 [doi]
AB  - Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity is regulated by dopamine D2 receptor 
      signaling and can be inhibited by psychoactive drugs in a D2 receptor-dependent 
      manner. However, GSK3β is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, and D2 
      receptor-expressing cells are distributed as a mosaic in multiple cortical regions. 
      This complicates the interrogation of GSK3β functions in cortical D2 cells in a 
      circuit-defined manner using conventional animal models. We used a 
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated intersectional approach to achieve targeted deletion of GSK3β 
      in D2-expressing neurons of the adult medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Isolation and 
      analysis of ribosome-associated RNA specifically from mPFC D2 neurons lacking GSK3β 
      demonstrated large-scale translatome alterations. Deletion of GSK3β in mPFC D2 
      neurons revealed its contribution to anxiety-related, cognitive, and social 
      behaviors. Our results underscore the viability of an intersectional knockout 
      approach to study functions of a ubiquitous gene in a network-defined fashion while 
      uncovering the contribution of GSK3β expressed in mPFC D2 neurons in the regulation 
      of behavioral dimensions related to mood and emotions. This advances our 
      understanding of GSK3β action at a brain circuit level and can potentially lead to 
      the development of circuit selective therapeutics.

AB  - The simplicity of the CRISPR/Cas9 system of genome engineering has opened up the 
      possibility of performing genome-wide targeted mutagenesis in cell lines, enabling 
      screening for cellular phenotypes resulting from genetic aberrations. Drosophila 
      cells have proven to be highly effective in identifying genes involved in cellular 
      processes through similar screens using partial knockdown by RNAi. This is in part 
      due to the lower degree of redundancy between genes in this organism, whilst still 
      maintaining highly conserved gene networks and orthologs of many human 
      disease-causing genes. The ability of CRISPR to generate genetic loss of function 
      mutations not only increases the magnitude of any effect over currently employed 
      RNAi techniques, but allows analysis over longer periods of time which can be 
      critical for certain phenotypes. In this study, we have designed and built a 
      genome-wide CRISPR library covering 13,501 genes, among which 8989 genes are 
      targeted by three or more independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Moreover, we 
      describe strategies to monitor the population of guide RNAs by high throughput 
      sequencing (HTS). We hope that this library will provide an invaluable resource for 
      the community to screen loss of function mutations for cellular phenotypes, and as a 
      source of guide RNA designs for future studies.

      of metabolic pathways, including those that can be used to assimilate naturally 
      abundant or easily generated feedstocks. For instance, levulinic acid (LA) is a 
      carbon source that is readily obtainable as a dehydration product of lignocellulosic 
      biomass and can serve as the sole carbon source for some bacteria. Yet, the genetics 
      and structure of LA catabolism have remained unknown. Here, we report the 
      identification and characterization of a seven-gene operon that enables LA 
      catabolism in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. When the pathway was reconstituted with 
      purified proteins, we observed the formation of four acyl-CoA intermediates, 
      including a unique 4-phosphovaleryl-CoA and the previously observed 
      3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA product. Using adaptive evolution, we obtained a mutant of 
      Escherichia coli LS5218 with functional deletions of fadE and atoC that was capable 
      of robust growth on LA when it expressed the five enzymes from the P. putida operon. 
      This discovery will enable more efficient use of biomass hydrolysates and metabolic 
      engineering to develop bioconversions using LA as a feedstock.

AB  - Mammalian microRNA expression is dysregulated in human cancer. However, the 
      functional relevance of many microRNAs in the context of tumor biology remains 
      unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we performed a global loss-of-function screen 
      to simultaneously test the functions of individual microRNAs and protein-coding 
      genes during the growth of a myeloid leukemia cell line. This approach identified 
      evolutionarily conserved human microRNAs that suppress or promote cell growth, 
      revealing that microRNAs are extensively integrated into the molecular networks that 
      control tumor cell physiology. miR-155 was identified as a top microRNA candidate 
      promoting cellular fitness, which we confirmed with two distinct miR-155-targeting 
      CRISPR-Cas9 lentiviral constructs. Further, we performed anti-correlation functional 
      profiling to predict relevant microRNA-tumor suppressor gene or microRNA-oncogene 
      interactions in these cells. This analysis identified miR-150 targeting of p53, a 
      connection that was experimentally validated. Taken together, our study describes a 
      powerful genetic approach by which the function of individual microRNAs can be 
      assessed on a global level, and its use will rapidly advance our understanding of 
      how microRNAs contribute to human disease.

AB  - DNA methylation contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity in somatic 
      cells, in part through the silencing of transposable elements. In this study, we use 
      CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete DNMT1, the DNA methyltransferase key for DNA 
      methylation maintenance, in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). We observe that 
      inactivation of DNMT1 in hNPCs results in viable, proliferating cells despite a 
      global loss of DNA CpG-methylation. DNA demethylation leads to specific 
      transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling of evolutionarily young, 
      hominoid-specific LINE-1 elements (L1s), while older L1s and other classes of 
      transposable elements remain silent. The activated L1s act as alternative promoters 
      for many protein-coding genes involved in neuronal functions, revealing a 
      hominoid-specific L1-based transcriptional network controlled by DNA methylation 
      that influences neuronal protein-coding genes. Our results provide mechanistic 
      insight into the role of DNA methylation in silencing transposable elements in 
      somatic human cells, as well as further implicating L1s in human brain development 
      and disease.

      more than 20 European partners, we recommend the foundation of an expert group 
      (European Steering Committee) to assess the potential benefits and draw-backs of 
      genome editing (off-targets, mosaicisms, etc.), and to design risk matrices and 
      scenarios for a responsible use of this promising technology. In addition, this 
      European steering committee will contribute in promoting an open debate on societal 
      aspects prior to a translation into national and international legislation.

AB  - The genus Sulfobacillus is a cohort of mildly thermophilic or thermotolerant 
      acidophiles within the phylum Firmicutes and requires extremely acidic environments 
      and hypersalinity for optimal growth. However, our understanding of them is still 
      preliminary partly because few genome sequences are available. Here, the draft 
      genome of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST was deciphered to obtain a 
      comprehensive insight into the genetic content and to understand the cellular 
      mechanisms necessary for its survival. Furthermore, the expressions of key genes 
      related with iron and sulfur oxidation were verified by semi-quantitative RT-PCR 
      analysis. The draft genome sequence of Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans strain ST, 
      which encodes 3225 predicted coding genes on a total length of 3,333,554 bp and a 
      48.35% G+C, revealed the high degree of heterogeneity with other Sulfobacillus 
      species. The presence of numerous transposases, genomic islands and complete 
      CRISPR/Cas defence systems testifies to its dynamic evolution consistent with the 
      genome heterogeneity. As expected, S. thermosulfidooxidans encodes a suit of 
      conserved enzymes required for the oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds (ISCs). 
      The model of sulfur oxidation in S. thermosulfidooxidans was proposed, which showed 
      some different characteristics from the sulfur oxidation of Gram-negative A. 
      ferrooxidans. Sulfur oxygenase reductase and heterodisulfide reductase were 
      suggested to play important roles in the sulfur oxidation. Although the iron 
      oxidation ability was observed, some key proteins cannot be identified in S. 
      thermosulfidooxidans. Unexpectedly, a predicted sulfocyanin is proposed to transfer 
      electrons in the iron oxidation. Furthermore, its carbon metabolism is rather 
      flexible, can perform the transformation of pentose through the oxidative and 
      non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways and has the ability to take up small 
      organic compounds. It encodes a multitude of heavy metal resistance systems to adapt 
      the heavy metal-containing environments.

AB  - Bacteria from the genus Pedobacter are a major component of microbial assemblages at 
      Hanford Site (a largely decommissioned nuclear production complex) in eastern 
      Washington state, USA, and have been shown to change significantly in abundance in 
      response to the subsurface intrusion of Columbia River water. Here we employed 
      single-cell genomics techniques to shed light on the physiological niche of these 
      micro-organisms. Analysis of four Pedobacter single amplified genomes (SAGs) from 
      Hanford Site sediments revealed a chemoheterotrophic lifestyle, with the potential 
      to exist under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions via expression of both 
      aa3-type and cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases. These SAGs encoded a wide range of 
      both intra- and extracellular carbohydrate-active enzymes, potentially enabling the 
      degradation of recalcitrant substrates such as xylan and chitin, and the utilization 
      of more labile sugars such as mannose and fucose. Coupled to these enzymes, a 
      diversity of transporters and sugar-binding molecules were involved in the uptake of 
      carbon from the extracellular local environment. The SAGs were enriched in 
      TonB-dependent receptors, which play a key role in uptake of substrates resulting 
      from degradation of recalcitrant carbon. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short 
      Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas mechanisms for resisting viral infections were 
      identified in all SAGs. These data demonstrate the potential mechanisms utilized for 
      persistence by heterotrophic micro-organisms in a carbon-limited aquifer, and hint 
      at potential linkages between observed Pedobacter abundance shifts within the 300 
      Area (in the south-eastern corner of the site) subsurface and biogeochemical shifts 
      associated with Columbia River water intrusion.

TI  - SPIRAL2 Stabilises Endoplasmic Microtubule Minus Ends in the Moss Physcomitrella 
      patens.
PG  - 53-60
LID - 10.1247/csf.18001 [doi]
AB  - Stabilisation of minus ends of microtubules (MTs) is critical for organising MT 
      networks in land plant cells, in which all MTs are nucleated independent of 
      centrosomes. Recently, Arabidopsis SPIRAL2 (SPR2) protein was shown to localise to 
      plus and minus ends of cortical MTs, and increase stability of both ends. Here, we 
      report molecular and functional characterisation of SPR2 of the basal land plant, 
      the moss Physcomitrella patens. In protonemal cells of P. patens, where 
      non-cortical, endoplasmic MT network is organised, we observed SPR2 at minus ends, 
      but not plus ends, of endoplasmic MTs and likely also of phragmoplast MTs. Minus end 
      decoration was reconstituted in vitro using purified SPR2, suggesting that moss SPR2 
      is a minus end-specific binding protein (-TIP). We generated a loss-of-function 
      mutant of SPR2, in which frameshift-causing deletions/insertions were introduced 
      into all four paralogous SPR2 genes by means of CRISPR/Cas9. Protonemal cells of the 
      mutant showed instability of endoplasmic MT minus ends. These results indicate that 
      moss SPR2 is a MT minus end stabilising factor.Key words: acentrosomal microtubule 
      network, microtubule minus end, P. patens, CAMSAP/Nezha/Patronin.

AB  - Protein complexes are assemblies of subunits that have co-evolved to execute one or 
      many coordinated functions in the cellular environment. Functional annotation of 
      mammalian protein complexes is critical to understanding biological processes, as 
      well as disease mechanisms. Here, we used genetic co-essentiality derived from 
      genome-scale RNAi- and CRISPR-Cas9-based fitness screens performed across hundreds 
      of human cancer cell lines to assign measures of functional similarity. From these 
      measures, we systematically built and characterized functional similarity networks 
      that recapitulate known structural and functional features of well-studied protein 
      complexes and resolve novel functional modules within complexes lacking structural 
      resolution, such as the mammalian SWI/SNF complex. Finally, by integrating 
      functional networks with large protein-protein interaction networks, we discovered 
      novel protein complexes involving recently evolved genes of unknown function. Taken 
      together, these findings demonstrate the utility of genetic perturbation screens 
      alone, and in combination with large-scale biophysical data, to enhance our 
      understanding of mammalian protein complexes in normal and disease states.

AB  - The placenta is an essential organ for the fetus, but its regulatory mechanism for 
      formation of functional trophoblast lineage remains elusive in humans. Although 
      widely known in mice, TEAD4 and its downstream targets CDX2 and GATA3 have not been 
      determined in human models. In this work, we used a human model of trophoblast 
      transition from BAP (BMP4, A83-01 and PD173074)-treated human embryonic stem cells 
      (hESCs) and performed multiple gain- and loss-of-function tests of TEAD4, CDX2 or 
      GATA3 to study their roles during this process. Although hESCs with TEAD4 deletion 
      maintain pluripotency, their trophoblast transition potentials are attenuated. This 
      impaired trophoblast transition could be rescued by separately overexpressing TEAD4, 
      CDX2 or GATA3. Furthermore, trophoblast transition from hESCs is also attenuated by 
      knockout of CDX2 but remains unaffected with deletion of GATA3. However, 
      CDX2-overexpressed hESCs maintain pluripotency, whereas overexpression of GATA3 in 
      hESCs leads to spontaneous differentiation including trophoblast lineage. In brief, 
      our findings using a human model of trophoblast transition from BAP-treated hESCs 
      reveal transcription roles of TEAD4, CDX2 and GATA in humans that are different from 
      those in mice. We hope that this evidence can aid in understanding the distinct 
      transcriptional network regulating trophoblast development in humans.

TI  - The Hippo pathway modulates resistance to BET proteins inhibitors in lung cancer 
      cells.

AB  - Inhibitors of BET proteins (BETi) are anti-cancer drugs that have shown efficacy in 
      pre-clinical settings and are currently in clinical trials for different types of 
      cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, no predictive 
      biomarker is available to identify patients that may benefit from this treatment. To 
      uncover the mechanisms of resistance to BETi, we performed a genome-scale 
      CRISPR/Cas9 screening in lung cancer cells. We identified three Hippo pathway genes, 
      LATS2, TAOK1, and NF2, as key determinants for sensitivity to BETi. The knockout of 
      these genes induces resistance to BETi, by promoting TAZ nuclear localization and 
      transcriptional activity. Conversely, TAZ expression promotes resistance to these 
      drugs. We also showed that TAZ, YAP, and their partner TEAD are direct targets of 
      BRD4 and that treatment with BETi downregulates their expression. Noticeably, 
      molecular alterations in one or more of these genes are present in a large fraction 
      of NSCLC patients and TAZ amplification or overexpression correlates with a worse 
      outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. Our data define the central role of Hippo pathway in 
      mediating resistance to BETi and provide a rationale for using BETi to counter-act 
      YAP/TAZ-mediated pro-oncogenic activity.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 in MDA-MB-231 breast 
      cancer cells suggests a role in cellular metabolism.

LID - 9804
AB  - Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1), present in all tissues, is classically 
      described as a phase-II xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme but can also catalyze the 
      hydrolysis of acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the absence of an arylamine 
      substrate using folate as a cofactor. NAT1 activity varies inter-individually and 
      has been shown to be overexpressed in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast 
      cancers. NAT1 has also been implicated in breast cancer progression however the 
      exact role of NAT1 remains unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the 
      effect of varying levels of NAT1 N-acetylation activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 
      cells on global cellular metabolism and to probe for unknown endogenous NAT1 
      substrates. Global, untargeted metabolomics was conducted via ultra performance 
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) on MDA-MB-231 breast 
      cancer cell lines constructed with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to vary only 
      in NAT1 N-acetylation activity. Many metabolites were differentially abundant in 
      NAT1-modified cell lines compared to the Scrambled parental cell line. 
      N-acetylasparagine and N-acetylputrescine abundances were strongly positively 
      correlated (r = 0.986 and r = 0.944, respectively) with NAT1 N-acetylation activity 
      whereas saccharopine abundance was strongly inversely correlated (r = -0.876). Two 
      of the most striking observations were a reduction in de novo pyrimidine 
      biosynthesis and defective β-oxidation of fatty acids in the absence of NAT1. We 
      have shown that NAT1 expression differentially affects cellular metabolism dependent 
      on the level of expression. Our results support the hypothesis that NAT1 is not just 
      a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme and may have a role in endogenous cellular 
      metabolism.

TI  - Endogenous epitope tagging of heat shock protein 70 isoform Hsc70 using CRISPR/Cas9.
PG  - 347-355
LID - 10.1007/s12192-017-0845-2 [doi]
AB  - Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is an evolutionarily well-conserved molecular 
      chaperone involved in several cellular processes such as folding of proteins, 
      modulating protein-protein interactions, and transport of proteins across the 
      membrane. Binding partners of Hsp70 (known as "clients") are identified on an 
      individual basis as researchers discover their particular protein of interest binds 
      to Hsp70. A full complement of Hsp70 interactors under multiple stress conditions 
      remains to be determined. A promising approach to characterizing the Hsp70 
      "interactome" is the use of protein epitope tagging and then affinity purification 
      followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS/MS). AP-MS analysis is a widely used method to 
      decipher protein-protein interaction networks and identifying protein functions. 
      Conventionally, the proteins are overexpressed ectopically which interferes with 
      protein complex stoichiometry, skewing AP-MS/MS data. In an attempt to solve this 
      issue, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to integrate a tandem-affinity 
      (TAP) epitope tag into the genomic locus of HSC70. This system offers several 
      benefits over existing expression systems including native expression, no 
      requirement for selection, and homogeneity between cells. This cell line, freely 
      available to chaperone researchers, will aid in small and large-scale protein 
      interaction studies as well as the study of biochemical activities and 
      structure-function relationships of the Hsc70 protein.

TI  - Sequence-dependent cargo recognition by SNX-BARs mediates retromer-independent 
      transport of CI-MPR.
PG  - 3695-3712
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703015 [doi]
AB  - Endosomal recycling of transmembrane proteins requires sequence-dependent 
      recognition of motifs present within their intracellular cytosolic domains. In this 
      study, we have reexamined the role of retromer in the sequence-dependent 
      endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) transport of the cation-independent mannose 
      6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). Although the knockdown or knockout of retromer does 
      not perturb CI-MPR transport, the targeting of the retromer-linked sorting nexin 
      (SNX)-Bin, Amphiphysin, and Rvs (BAR) proteins leads to a pronounced defect in 
      CI-MPR endosome-to-TGN transport. The retromer-linked SNX-BAR proteins comprise 
      heterodimeric combinations of SNX1 or SNX2 with SNX5 or SNX6 and serve to regulate 
      the biogenesis of tubular endosomal sorting profiles. We establish that SNX5 and 
      SNX6 associate with the CI-MPR through recognition of a specific WLM endosome-to-TGN 
      sorting motif. From validating the CI-MPR dependency of SNX1/2-SNX5/6 tubular 
      profile formation, we provide a mechanism for coupling sequence-dependent cargo 
      recognition with the biogenesis of tubular profiles required for endosome-to-TGN 
      transport. Therefore, the data presented in this study reappraise retromer's role in 
      CI-MPR transport.

TI  - RBL1 (p107) functions as tumor suppressor in glioblastoma and small-cell pancreatic 
      neuroendocrine carcinoma in Xenopus tropicalis.
PG  - 2692-2706

AB  - Alterations of the retinoblastoma and/or the p53 signaling network are associated 
      with specific cancers such as high-grade astrocytoma/glioblastoma, small-cell lung 
      cancer (SCLC), choroid plexus tumors, and small-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine 
      carcinoma (SC-PaNEC). However, the intricate functional redundancy between RB1 and 
      the related pocket proteins RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130 in suppressing tumorigenesis 
      remains poorly understood. Here we performed lineage-restricted parallel 
      inactivation of rb1 and rbl1 by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the true 
      diploid Xenopus tropicalis to gain insight into this in vivo redundancy. We show 
      that while rb1 inactivation is sufficient to induce choroid plexus papilloma, 
      combined rb1 and rbl1 inactivation is required and sufficient to drive SC-PaNEC, 
      retinoblastoma and astrocytoma. Further, using a novel Li-Fraumeni 
      syndrome-mimicking tp53 mutant X. tropicalis line, we demonstrate increased 
      malignancy of rb1/rbl1-mutant glioma towards glioblastoma upon concomitant 
      inactivation of tp53. Interestingly, although clinical SC-PaNEC samples are 
      characterized by abnormal p53 expression or localization, in the current 
      experimental models, the tp53 status had little effect on the establishment and 
      growth of SC-PaNEC, but may rather be essential for maintaining chromosomal 
      stability. SCLC was only rarely observed in our experimental setup, indicating 
      requirement of additional or alternative oncogenic insults. In conclusion, we used 
      CRISPR/Cas9 to delineate the tumor suppressor properties of Rbl1, generating new 
      insights in the functional redundancy within the retinoblastoma protein family in 
      suppressing neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer and glioma/glioblastoma.

TI  - The Long Non-coding RNA Flatr Anticipates Foxp3 Expression in Regulatory T Cells.
PG  - 1989
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01989 [doi]
LID - 1989
AB  - Mammalian genomes encode a plethora of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). These 
      transcripts are thought to regulate gene expression, influencing biological 
      processes from development to pathology. Results from the few lncRNA that have been 
      studied in the context of the immune system have highlighted potentially critical 
      functions as network regulators. Here we explored the nature of the lncRNA 
      transcriptome in regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4(+) T cells required to 
      establish and maintain immunological self-tolerance. The identified Treg lncRNA 
      transcriptome showed distinct differences from that of non-regulatory CD4(+) T 
      cells, with evidence of direct shaping of the lncRNA transcriptome by Foxp3, the 
      master transcription factor driving the distinct mRNA profile of Tregs. Treg lncRNA 
      changes were disproportionally reversed in the absence of Foxp3, with an enrichment 
      for colocalisation with Foxp3 DNA binding sites, indicating a direct coordination of 
      transcription by Foxp3 independent of the mRNA coordination function. We further 
      identified a novel lncRNA Flatr, as a member of the core Treg lncRNA transcriptome. 
      Flatr expression anticipates Foxp3 expression during in vitro Treg conversion, and 
      Flatr-deficient mice show a mild delay in in vitro and peripheral Treg induction. 
      These results implicate Flatr as part of the upstream cascade leading to Treg 
      conversion, and may provide clues as to the nature of this process.

TI  - Engineered dCas9 with reduced toxicity in bacteria: implications for genetic circuit 
      design.
PG  - 11115-11125
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky884 [doi]
AB  - Large synthetic genetic circuits require the simultaneous expression of many 
      regulators. Deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) can serve as a repressor by having a small 
      guide RNA (sgRNA) direct it to bind a promoter. The programmability and specificity 
      of RNA:DNA basepairing simplifies the generation of many orthogonal sgRNAs that, in 
      theory, could serve as a large set of regulators in a circuit. However, dCas9 is 
      toxic in many bacteria, thus limiting how high it can be expressed, and low 
      concentrations are quickly sequestered by multiple sgRNAs. Here, we construct a 
      non-toxic version of dCas9 by eliminating PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) binding 
      with a R1335K mutation (dCas9*) and recovering DNA binding by fusing it to the PhlF 
      repressor (dCas9*_PhlF). Both the 30 bp PhlF operator and 20 bp sgRNA binding site 
      are required to repress a promoter. The larger region required for recognition 
      mitigates toxicity in Escherichia coli, allowing up to 9600 ± 800 molecules of 
      dCas9*_PhlF per cell before growth or morphology are impacted, as compared to 530 ± 
      40 molecules of dCas9. Further, PhlF multimerization leads to an increase in average 
      cooperativity from n = 0.9 (dCas9) to 1.6 (dCas9*_PhlF). A set of 30 orthogonal 
      sgRNA-promoter pairs are characterized as NOT gates; however, the simultaneous use 
      of multiple sgRNAs leads to a monotonic decline in repression and after 15 are 
      co-expressed the dynamic range is <10-fold. This work introduces a non-toxic variant 
      of dCas9, critical for its use in applications in metabolic engineering and 
      synthetic biology, and exposes a limitation in the number of regulators that can be 
      used in one cell when they rely on a shared resource.

AB  - A longstanding goal of synthetic biology has been the programmable control of 
      cellular functions. Central to this is the creation of versatile regulatory toolsets 
      that allow for programmable control of gene expression. Of the many regulatory 
      molecules available, RNA regulators offer the intriguing possibility of de novo 
      design-allowing for the bottom-up molecular-level design of genetic control systems. 
      Here we present a computational design approach for the creation of a bacterial 
      regulator called Small Transcription Activating RNAs (STARs) and create a library of 
      high-performing and orthogonal STARs that achieve up to ~ 9000-fold gene activation. 
      We demonstrate the versatility of these STARs-from acting synergistically with 
      existing constitutive and inducible regulators, to reprogramming cellular phenotypes 
      and controlling multigene metabolic pathway expression. Finally, we combine these 
      new STARs with themselves and CRISPRi transcriptional repressors to deliver new 
      types of RNA-based genetic circuitry that allow for sophisticated and temporal 
      control of gene expression.

TI  - Genetic Tools for Streamlined and Accelerated Pathway Engineering in Yarrowia 
      lipolytica.
PG  - 155-177
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9142-6_11 [doi]
AB  - Yarrowia lipolytica is an industrial oleaginous yeast that has many attractive 
      physiological and metabolic characteristics for various biotechnological 
      applications. Although it has a long history of industrial applications, the number 
      of genetic tools available to effectively and efficiently engineer Y. lipolytica 
      still falls behind the vast number of tools available for common organisms such as 
      Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this protocol, we have developed a 
      complete and versatile genetic toolkit tailored for facile genetic manipulation in 
      Y. lipolytica. We created a versatile DNA assembly platform YaliBrick, which can 
      streamline the cloning of large multigene pathways with reused genetic parts. We 
      established a sensitive luciferase reporter assay to characterize a set of 12 native 
      promoters. In addition, we used YaliBrick to generate different gene configurations 
      in multigene constructs. The five-gene biosynthetic pathway of the anticancer, 
      antimicrobial pigment violacein was rapidly assembled in 1 week to demonstrate the 
      simplicity and effectiveness of integrating pathway-balancing strategies with our 
      YaliBrick vectors. In the end, we incorporated CRISPR-Cas9 into our YaliBrick 
      vectors and achieved indel mutation and frameshift gene deletion at the CAN1 
      (arginine permease) genomic loci of Yarrowia lipolytica. The reported protocol 
      provides a standard procedure to streamline and accelerate metabolic pathway 
      engineering in Yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  - Systematic CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Modifications of Plasmodium yoelii ApiAP2 Genes 
      Reveal Functional Insights into Parasite Development.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01986-17 [doi]
LID - e01986-17
AB  - Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle with multiple developmental stages in 
      mosquito and vertebrate hosts, and different developmental stages express unique 
      sets of genes. Unexpectedly, many transcription factors (TFs) commonly found in 
      eukaryotic organisms are absent in malaria parasites; instead, a family of genes 
      encoding proteins similar to the plant Apetala2 (ApiAP2) transcription factors is 
      expanded in the parasites. Several malaria ApiAP2 genes have been shown to play a 
      critical role in parasite development; however, the functions of the majority of the 
      ApiAP2 genes remain to be elucidated. In particular, no study on the Plasmodium 
      yoelii ApiAP2 (PyApiAP2) gene family has been reported so far. This study 
      systematically investigated the functional roles of PyApiAP2 genes in parasite 
      development. Twenty-four of the 26 PyApiAP2 genes were selected for disruption, and 
      12 were successfully knocked out using the clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) method. The effects of 
      gene knockout (KO) on parasite development in mouse and mosquito stages were 
      evaluated. Ten of 12 successfully disrupted genes, including two genes that have not 
      been functionally characterized in any Plasmodium species previously, were shown to 
      be critical for P. yoelii development of sexual and mosquito stages. Additionally, 
      seven of the genes were labeled for protein expression analysis, revealing important 
      information supporting their functions. This study represents the first systematic 
      functional characterization of the P. yoelii ApiAP2 gene family and discovers 
      important insights on the roles of the ApiAP2 genes in parasite 
      development.IMPORTANCE Malaria is a parasitic disease that infects hundreds of 
      millions of people, leading to an estimated 0.35 million deaths in 2015. A better 
      understanding of the mechanism of gene expression regulation during parasite 
      development may provide important clues for disease control and prevention. In this 
      study, systematic gene disruption experiments were performed to study the functional 
      roles of members of the Plasmodium yoelii ApiAP2 (PyApiAP2) gene family in parasite 
      development. Genes that are critical for the development of male and female 
      gametocytes, oocysts, and sporozoites were characterized. The protein expression 
      profiles for seven of the PyApiAP2 gene products were also analyzed, revealing 
      important information on their functions. This study provides expression and 
      functional information for many PyApiAP2 genes, which can be explored for disease 
      management.

      Cells for the Construction of Synthetic Genetic Circuits.
PG  - 1050-1058
AB  - Transcriptional activator-like effector (TALE)- and CRISPR/Cas9-based designable 
      recognition domains represent a technological breakthrough not only for genome 
      editing but also for building designed genetic circuits. Both platforms are able to 
      target rarely occurring DNA segments, even within complex genomes. TALE and dCas9 
      domains, genetically fused to transcriptional regulatory domains, can be used for 
      the construction of engineered logic circuits. Here we benchmarked the performance 
      of the two platforms, targeting the same DNA sequences, to compare their advantages 
      for the construction of designed circuits in mammalian cells. Optimal targeting 
      strands for repression and activation of dCas9-based designed transcription factors 
      were identified; both platforms exhibited good orthogonality and were used to 
      construct functionally complete NOR gates. Although the CRISPR/dCas9 system is 
      clearly easier to construct, TALE-based activators were significantly stronger, and 
      the TALE-based platform performed better, especially for the construction of layered 
      circuits.

AB  - Behavioral neuroendocrinology has benefited tremendously from the use of a wide 
      range of model organisms that are ideally suited for particular questions. However, 
      in recent years the ability to manipulate the genomes of laboratory strains of mice 
      has led to rapid advances in our understanding of the role of specific genes, 
      circuits and neural populations in regulating behavior. While genome manipulation in 
      mice has been a boon for behavioral neuroscience, the intensive focus on the mouse 
      restricts the diversity in behavioral questions that can be investigated using 
      state-of-the-art techniques. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has great potential for 
      efficiently generating mutants in non-traditional animal models and consequently to 
      reinvigorate comparative behavioral neuroendocrinology. Here we describe the 
      efficient generation of oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) mutant prairie voles (Microtus 
      ochrogaster) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and describe initial behavioral 
      phenotyping focusing on behaviors relevant to autism. Oxtr mutant male voles show no 
      disruption in pup ultrasonic vocalization, anxiety as measured by the open field 
      test, alloparental behavior, or sociability in the three chamber test. Mutants did 
      however show a modest elevation in repetitive behavior in the marble burying test, 
      and an impairment in preference for social novelty. The ability to efficiently 
      generate targeted mutations in the prairie vole genome will greatly expand the 
      utility of this model organism for discovering the genetic and circuit mechanisms 
      underlying complex social behaviors, and serves as a proof of principle for 
      expanding this approach to other non-traditional model organisms.

AB  - Normal T-cell differentiation requires a complex regulatory network which supports a 
      series of maturation steps, including lineage commitment, T-cell receptor (TCR) gene 
      rearrangement, and thymic positive and negative selection. However, the underlying 
      molecular mechanisms are difficult to assess due to limited T-cell models. Here we 
      explore the use of the pro-T-cell line P5424 to study early T-cell differentiation. 
      Stimulation of P5424 cells by the calcium ionophore ionomycin together with PMA 
      resulted in gene regulation of T-cell differentiation and activation markers, 
      partially mimicking the CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative (DN) to double positive (DP) 
      transition and some aspects of subsequent T-cell maturation and activation. Global 
      analysis of gene expression, along with kinetic experiments, revealed a significant 
      association between the dynamic expression of coding genes and neighbor lncRNAs 
      including many newly-discovered transcripts, thus suggesting potential 
      co-regulation. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic deletion of Robnr, an inducible lncRNA 
      located downstream of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2, demonstrated a critical role of 
      the Robnr locus in the induction of Bcl2. Thus, the pro-T-cell line P5424 is a 
      powerful model system to characterize regulatory networks involved in early T-cell 
      differentiation and maturation.

TI  - A Novel Screening Approach for the Dissection of Cellular Regulatory Networks of 
      NF-κB Using Arrayed CRISPR gRNA Libraries.
PG  - 618-633
LID - 10.1177/2472555220926160 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 is increasingly being used as a tool to prosecute functional genomic 
      screens. However, it is not yet possible to apply the approach at scale across a 
      full breadth of cell types and endpoints. In order to address this, we developed a 
      novel and robust workflow for array-based lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 screening. We 
      utilized a β-lactamase reporter gene assay to investigate mediators of 
      TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling. The system was adapted for CRISPR/Cas9 through the 
      development of a cell line stably expressing Cas9 and application of a lentiviral 
      gRNA library comprising mixtures of four gRNAs per gene. We screened a 743-gene 
      kinome library whereupon hits were independently ranked by percent inhibition, Z' 
      score, strictly standardized mean difference, and T statistic. A consolidated and 
      optimized ranking was generated using Borda-based methods. Screening data quality 
      was above acceptable limits (Z' ≥ 0.5). In order to determine the contribution of 
      individual gRNAs and to better understand false positives and negatives, a subset of 
      gRNAs, against 152 genes, were profiled in singlicate format. We highlight the use 
      of known reference genes and high-throughput, next-generation amplicon and RNA 
      sequencing to assess screen data quality. Screening with singlicate gRNAs was more 
      successful than screening with mixtures at identifying genes with known regulatory 
      roles in TNF-α-mediated NF-κB signaling and was found to be superior to previous 
      RNAi-based methods. These results add to the available data on TNF-α-mediated NF-κB 
      signaling and establish a high-throughput functional genomic screening approach, 
      utilizing a vector-based arrayed gRNA library, applicable across a wide variety of 
      endpoints and cell types at a genome-wide scale.

TI  - Intact Arabidopsis RPB1 functions in stem cell niches maintenance and cell cycling 
      control.
PG  - 150-167
LID - 10.1111/tpj.13939 [doi]
AB  - Plant meristem activity depends on accurate execution of transcriptional networks 
      required for establishing optimum functioning of stem cell niches. An Arabidopsis 
      mutant card1-1 (constitutive auxin response with DR5:GFP) that encodes a truncated 
      RPB1 (RNA Polymerase II's largest subunit) with shortened C-terminal domain (CTD) 
      was identified. Phosphorylation of the CTD repeats of RPB1 is coupled to 
      transcription in eukaryotes. Here we uncover that the truncated CTD of RPB1 
      disturbed cell cycling and enlarged the size of shoot and root meristem. The defects 
      in patterning of root stem cell niche in card1-1 indicates that intact CTD of RPB1 
      is necessary for fine-tuning the specific expression of genes responsible for 
      cell-fate determination. The gene-edited plants with different CTD length of RPB1, 
      created by CRISPR-CAS9 technology, confirmed that both the full length and the 
      DK-rich tail of RPB1's CTD play roles in the accurate transcription of CYCB1;1 
      encoding a cell-cycle marker protein in root meristem and hence participate in 
      maintaining root meristem size. Our experiment proves that the intact RPB1 CTD is 
      necessary for stem cell niche maintenance, which is mediated by transcriptional 
      regulation of cell cycling genes.

TI  - Segregation in the Golgi complex precedes export of endolysosomal proteins in 
      distinct transport carriers.
PG  - 4141-4151
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201707172 [doi]
AB  - Biosynthetic sorting of newly synthesized transmembrane cargos to endosomes and 
      lysosomes is thought to occur at the TGN through recognition of sorting signals in 
      the cytosolic tails of the cargos by adaptor proteins, leading to cargo packaging 
      into coated vesicles destined for the endolysosomal system. Here we present evidence 
      for a different mechanism in which two sets of endolysosomal proteins undergo early 
      segregation to distinct domains of the Golgi complex by virtue of the proteins' 
      luminal and transmembrane domains. Proteins in one Golgi domain exit into 
      predominantly vesicular carriers by interaction of sorting signals with adaptor 
      proteins, but proteins in the other domain exit into predominantly tubular carriers 
      shared with plasma membrane proteins, independently of signal-adaptor interactions. 
      These findings demonstrate that sorting of endolysosomal proteins begins at an 
      earlier stage and involves mechanisms that partly differ from those described by 
      classical models.

TI  - Arginine methylation of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A senses glucose to promote 
      human colorectal cancer cell survival.
PG  - 1394-1405
LID - 10.1007/s11427-019-1562-y [doi]
AB  - Cancer cells remodel their metabolic network to adapt to variable nutrient 
      availability. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) plays protective and biosynthetic 
      roles by oxidizing glucose to generate reducing power and ribose. How cancer cells 
      modulate PPP activity in response to glucose supply remains unclear. Here we show 
      that ribose-5-phosphate isomerase A (RPIA), an enzyme in PPP, directly interacts 
      with co-activator associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) and is methylated 
      at arginine 42 (R42). R42 methylation up-regulates the catalytic activity of RPIA. 
      Furthermore, glucose deprivation strengthens the binding of CARM1 with RPIA to 
      induce R42 hypermethylation. Insufficient glucose supply links to RPIA 
      hypermethylation at R42, which increases oxidative PPP flux. RPIA methylation 
      supports ROS clearance by enhancing NADPH production and fuels nucleic acid 
      synthesis by increasing ribose supply. Importantly, RPIA methylation at R42 
      significantly potentiates colorectal cancer cell survival under glucose starvation. 
      Collectively, RPIA methylation connects glucose availability to nucleotide synthesis 
      and redox homeostasis.

TI  - Cardiac‑specific deletion of natriuretic peptide receptor A induces differential 
      myocardial expression of circular RNA and mRNA molecules involved in metabolism in 
      mice.
LID - 50 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2020.11688 [doi]
AB  - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are important 
      biological markers and regulators of cardiac function. The natriuretic peptide 
      receptor A (NPRA), also known as NPR1 or guanylyl cyclase A, binds ANP and BNP to 
      initiate transmembrane signal transduction by elevating the intracellular levels of 
      cyclic guanosine monophosphate. However, the effects and mechanisms downstream of 
      NPRA are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes 
      in the global pattern of mRNA and circular RNA (circRNA) expression in 
      NPRA<sup>‑/‑</sup> and NPRA<sup>+/+</sup> myocardium. Differentially expressed mRNA 
      molecules were characterised using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
      Genomes pathway analysis and were found to be primarily related to metabolic 
      processes. Moreover, circRNA expression was also examined, and a possible competing 
      endogenous RNA network consisting of circRNA, microRNA (miRNA), and mRNA molecules 
      was constructed. The results of this study indicated that NPRA may play a role in 
      cardiac metabolism, which could be mediated by circRNA through endogenous 
      competition mechanisms. These findings may provide insight into future 
      characterisation of various ceRNA network pathways.

TI  - FAM46C controls antibody production by the polyadenylation of immunoglobulin mRNAs 
      and inhibits cell migration in multiple myeloma.
PG  - 4171-4182
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.15078 [doi]
AB  - FAM46C, frequently mutated in multiple myeloma (MM), has recently been shown to 
      encode a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (ncPAP). However, its target mRNAs and its 
      role in MM pathogenesis remain mostly unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and gene 
      expression analysis, we found that the inactivation of FAM46C in MM down-regulates 
      immunoglobulins (Igs) and several mRNAs encoding ER-resident proteins, including 
      some involved in unfolded protein response and others that affect glycosylation. 
      Interestingly, we show that FAM46C expression is induced during plasma cell (PC) 
      differentiation and that Ig mRNAs encoding heavy and light chains are substrates of 
      the ncPAP, as revealed by poly(A) tail-length determination assays. The absence of 
      the ncPAP results in Ig mRNA poly(A) tail-shortening, leading to a reduction in mRNA 
      and protein abundance. On the other hand, loss of FAM46C up-regulates 
      metastasis-associated lncRNA MALAT1 and results in a sharp increase in the migration 
      ability. This phenotype depends mainly on the activation of PI3K/Rac1 signalling, 
      which might have significant therapeutic implications. In conclusion, our results 
      identify Ig mRNAs as targets of FAM46C, reveal an important function of this protein 
      during PC maturation to increase antibody production and suggest that its role as a 
      tumour suppressor might be related to the inhibition of myeloma cell migration.

AB  - Methods for simple and efficient regulation of metabolic pathway genes are essential 
      for maximizing product titers and conversion yields, and for minimizing the 
      metabolic burden caused by heterologous expression of multiple genes often in the 
      operon context. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) 
      interference (CRISPRi) is emerging as a promising tool for transcriptional 
      modulation. In this study, we developed a regulatable CRISPRi system for fine-tuning 
      biosynthetic pathways and thus directing carbon flux toward target product 
      synthesis. By exploiting engineered Escherichia coli harboring a biosynthetic 
      mevalonate (MVA) pathway and plant-derived terpenoid synthases, the CRISPRi system 
      successfully modulated the expression of all the MVA pathway genes in the context of 
      operon and blocked the transcription of the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase enzyme that 
      catalyzes the first step in the MVA pathway. This CRISPRi-guided balancing of 
      expression of MVA pathway genes led to enhanced production of (-)-α-bisabolol (C15) 
      and lycopene (C40) and alleviation of cell growth inhibition that may be caused by 
      expression of multiple enzymes or production of toxic intermediate metabolites in 
      the MVA pathway. Coupling CRISPRi to cell growth by regulating an endogenous 
      essential gene (ispA) increased isoprene (C5) production. The regulatable CRISPRi 
      system proved to be a robust platform for systematic modulation of biosynthetic and 
      endogenous gene expression, and can be used to tune biosynthetic metabolic pathways. 
      Its application can enable the development of microbial 'smart cell' factories that 
      can produce other industrially valuable products in the future.

AB  - Despite the availability of whole-genome sequences for almost all model organisms, 
      making faithful predictions of gene expression levels based solely on the 
      corresponding promoter sequences remains a challenge. Plasmid-based approaches and 
      methods involving selection markers are not ideal due to copy-number fluctuations 
      and their disruptive nature. Here, we present a genome editing method using the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 complex and elucidate insights into the activity of canonical promoters 
      in live yeast cells. The method involves the introduction of a novel cut site into a 
      specific genomic location, followed by the integration of an edited sequence into 
      the same location in a scarless manner. Using this method to edit the GAL1 and GAL80 
      promoter sequences, we found that the relative positioning of promoter elements was 
      critically important for setting promoter activity levels in single cells. The 
      method can be extended to other organisms to decode genotype-phenotype relationships 
      in various gene networks.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful method for dissecting 
      intercellular heterogeneity during development. Conventional trajectory analysis 
      provides only a pseudotime of development, and often discards cell-cycle events as 
      confounding factors. Here using matched cell population RNA-seq (cpRNA-seq) as a 
      reference, we developed an "iCpSc" package for integrative analysis of cpRNA-seq and 
      scRNA-seq data. By generating a computational model for reference "biological 
      differentiation time" using cell population data and applying it to single-cell 
      data, we unbiasedly associated cell-cycle checkpoints to the internal molecular 
      timer of single cells. Through inferring a network flow from cpRNA-seq to scRNA-seq 
      data, we predicted a role of M phase in controlling the speed of neural 
      differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, and validated it through gene 
      knockout (KO) experiments. By linking temporally matched cpRNA-seq and scRNA-seq 
      data, our approach provides an effective and unbiased approach for identifying 
      developmental trajectory and timing-related regulatory events.

TI  - Anthropoid primate-specific retroviral element THE1B controls expression of CRH in 
      placenta and alters gestation length.

AB  - Pregnancy and parturition are intricately regulated to ensure successful 
      reproductive outcomes. However, the factors that control gestational length in 
      humans and other anthropoid primates remain poorly defined. Here, we show the 
      endogenous retroviral long terminal repeat transposon-like human element 1B (THE1B) 
      selectively controls placental expression of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) 
      that, in turn, influences gestational length and birth timing. Placental expression 
      of CRH and subsequently prolonged gestational length were found in two independent 
      strains of transgenic mice carrying a 180-kb human bacterial artificial chromosome 
      (BAC) DNA that contained the full length of CRH and extended flanking regions, 
      including THE1B. Restricted deletion of THE1B silenced placental CRH expression and 
      normalized birth timing in these transgenic lines. Furthermore, we revealed an 
      interaction at the 5' insertion site of THE1B with distal-less homeobox 3 (DLX3), a 
      transcription factor expressed in placenta. Together, these findings suggest that 
      retroviral insertion of THE1B into the anthropoid primate genome may have initiated 
      expression of CRH in placental syncytiotrophoblasts via DLX3 and that this placental 
      CRH is sufficient to alter the timing of birth.

AB  - Min6 cells, a mouse β cell line derived from transgenic mouse expressing the large 
      T-antigen of SV40 in pancreatic beta cells, are commonly utilized as an in vitro 
      cellular model for investigating targets involved in insulin secretion. Epac2, an 
      exchange protein that can be directly activated by cyclic AMP (cAMP), is critical 
      for pharmacologic stimuli-induced insulin secretion and has been hypothesized to be 
      a direct target of sulfonylurea. Previous loss of function studies only specifically 
      knocked out EPAC2 isoform A, leaving the other two isoforms intact. In this study, 
      we investigated the function of EPAC2 in Min6 cells by generating EPAC2 knock-out 
      sublines using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, by removing all three isoforms of EPAC2. Our 
      results indicate that Min6 cells can be successfully cloned from a single cell after 
      electroporation with plasmids expressing EPAC2 specific guide RNA, Cas9 and GFP, 
      followed by sorting for GFP expressing single cells. Two clones were found to have a 
      single nucleotide deletion in targeted site of EPAC2 gene by sequencing, therefore 
      creating a frame shift in exon 13. The EPAC2 null clones have an unexpectedly 
      increased secretion of insulin at basal level and an elevated total intracellular 
      insulin content. However, EPAC2 deficiency impaires glucose and sulfonylurea induced 
      insulin secretion without affecting sulfonylurea binding to cells. Potassium 
      chloride induced insulin secretion remains intact. Interestingly, cAMP levels 
      remained unchanged in EPAC2 null cells during these processes. To understand the 
      global function of EPAC2, RNA Seq study was performed, which reveals that EPAC2 
      deficiency affects expression of multiple previously unrecognized genes, suggesting 
      that EPAC2 can function through multiple pathways in addition to being a cAMP 
      sensor.

AB  - Genome integration is a vital step for implementing large biochemical pathways to 
      build a stable microbial cell factory. Although traditional strain construction 
      strategies are well established for the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
      recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering allow much higher 
      throughput and robustness in terms of strain construction. In this chapter, we 
      describe CasEMBLR, a highly efficient and marker-free genome engineering method for 
      one-step integration of in vivo assembled expression cassettes in multiple genomic 
      sites simultaneously. CasEMBLR capitalizes on the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate 
      double-strand breaks in genomic loci, thus prompting native homologous recombination 
      (HR) machinery to integrate exogenously derived homology templates. As 
      proof-of-principle for microbial cell factory development, CasEMBLR was used for 
      one-step assembly and marker-free integration of the carotenoid pathway from 15 
      exogenously supplied DNA parts into three targeted genomic loci. As a second 
      proof-of-principle, a total of ten DNA parts were assembled and integrated in two 
      genomic loci to construct a tyrosine production strain, and at the same time 
      knocking out two genes. This new method complements and improves the field of genome 
      engineering in S. cerevisiae by providing a more flexible platform for rapid and 
      precise strain building.

TI  - Core Hippo pathway components act as a brake on Yap and Taz in the development and 
      maintenance of the biliary network.
LID - 10.1242/dev.184242 [doi]
LID - dev184242
AB  - The development of the biliary system is a complex yet poorly understood process, 
      with relevance to multiple diseases, including biliary atresia, choledochal cysts 
      and gallbladder agenesis. We present here a crucial role for Hippo-Yap/Taz signaling 
      in this context. Analysis of sav1 mutant zebrafish revealed dysplastic morphology 
      and expansion of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary cells, and ultimately 
      larval lethality. Biliary dysgenesis, but not larval lethality, is driven primarily 
      by Yap signaling. Re-expression of Sav1 protein in sav1 (-/-) hepatocytes is able to 
      overcome these initial deficits and allows sav1 (-/-) fish to survive, suggesting 
      cell non-autonomous signaling from hepatocytes. Examination of sav1 (-/-) rescued 
      adults reveals loss of gallbladder and formation of dysplastic cell masses 
      expressing biliary markers, suggesting roles for Hippo signaling in extrahepatic 
      biliary carcinomas. Deletion of stk3 revealed that the phenotypes observed in sav1 
      mutant fish function primarily through canonical Hippo signaling and supports a role 
      for phosphatase PP2A, but also suggests Sav1 has functions in addition to 
      facilitating Stk3 activity. Overall, this study defines a role for Hippo-Yap 
      signaling in the maintenance of both intra- and extrahepatic biliary ducts.

TI  - Clustering-local-unique-enriched-signals (CLUES) promotes identification of novel

LID - e0206844
AB  - BACKGROUND: Key regulators of developmental processes can be prioritized through 
      integrated analysis of ChIP-Seq data of master transcriptional factors (TFs) such as 
      Nanog and Oct4, active histone modifications (HMs) such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and 
      repressive HMs such as H3K27me3. Recent studies show that broad enrichment signals 
      such as super-enhancers and broad H3K4me3 enrichment signals play more dominant 
      roles than short enrichment signals of the master TFs and H3K4me3 in epigenetic 
      regulatory mechanism. Besides the broad enrichment signals, up to ten thousands of 
      short enrichment signals of these TFs and HMs exist in genome. Prioritization of 
      these broad enrichment signals from ChIP-Seq data is a prerequisite for such 
      integrated analysis. RESULTS: Here, we present a method named 
      Clustering-Local-Unique-Enriched-Signals (CLUES), which uses an 
      adaptive-size-windows strategy to identify enriched regions (ERs) and cluster them 
      into broad enrichment signals. Tested on 62 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets of Ctcf and 
      Nrsf, CLUES performs equally well as MACS2 regarding prioritization of ERs with the 
      TF's motif. Tested on 165 ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and 
      H3K36me3, CLUES performs better than existing algorithms on prioritizing broad 
      enrichment signals implicating cell functions influenced by epigenetic regulatory 
      mechanism in cells. Most importantly, CLUES helps to confirm several novel 
      regulators of mouse ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency through integrated 
      analysis of prioritized broad enrichment signals of H3K4me3, H3K27me3, Nanog and 
      Oct4 with the support of a CRISPR/Cas9 negative selection genetic screen. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CLUES holds promise for prioritizing broad enrichment signals from 
      ChIP-Seq data. The download site for CLUES is https://github.com/Wuchao1984/CLUESv1.

TI  - p53 mitotic centrosome localization preserves centrosome integrity and works as 
      sensor for the mitotic surveillance pathway.
PG  - 850
LID - 10.1038/s41419-019-2076-1 [doi]
LID - 850
AB  - Centrosomal p53 has been described for three decades but its role is still unclear. 
      We previously reported that, in proliferating human cells, p53 transiently moves to 
      centrosomes at each mitosis. Such p53 mitotic centrosome localization (p53-MCL) 
      occurs independently from DNA damage but requires ATM-mediated p53Ser15 
      phosphorylation (p53Ser15(P)) on discrete cytoplasmic p53 foci that, through MT 
      dynamics, move to centrosomes during the mitotic spindle formation. Here, we show 
      that inhibition of p53-MCL, obtained by p53 depletion or selective impairment of p53 
      centrosomal localization, induces centrosome fragmentation in human nontransformed 
      cells. In contrast, tumor cells or mouse cells tolerate p53 depletion, as expected, 
      and p53-MCL inhibition. Such tumor- and species-specific behavior of centrosomal p53 
      resembles that of the recently identified sensor of centrosome-loss, whose 
      activation triggers the mitotic surveillance pathway in human nontransformed cells 
      but not in tumor cells or mouse cells. The mitotic surveillance pathway prevents the 
      growth of human cells with increased chance of making mitotic errors and 
      accumulating numeral chromosome defects. Thus, we evaluated whether p53-MCL could 
      work as a centrosome-loss sensor and contribute to the activation of the mitotic 
      surveillance pathway. We provide evidence that centrosome-loss triggered by PLK4 
      inhibition makes p53 orphan of its mitotic dock and promotes accumulation of 
      discrete p53Ser15(P) foci. These p53 foci are required for the recruitment of 53BP1, 
      a key effector of the mitotic surveillance pathway. Consistently, cells from 
      patients with constitutive impairment of p53-MCL, such as ATM- and PCNT-mutant 
      carriers, accumulate numeral chromosome defects. These findings indicate that, in 
      nontransformed human cells, centrosomal p53 contributes to safeguard genome 
      integrity by working as sensor for the mitotic surveillance pathway.

      signaling networks and thereby modulate complex cellular responses, but so far only 
      limited data are available on miRNAs that regulate cartilage development. Here, we 
      characterize a miRNA that promotes the biosynthesis of a key component in the 
      RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in cartilage. Specifically, by transcriptome profiling we 
      identified miR-322 to be upregulated during chondrocyte differentiation. Among the 
      various miR-322 target genes in the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, only Mek1 was identified as 
      a regulated target in chondrocytes. Surprisingly, an increased concentration of 
      miR-322 stabilizes Mek1 mRNA to raise protein levels and dampen ERK1/2 
      phosphorylation, while cartilage-specific inactivation of miR322 in mice linked the 
      loss of miR-322 to decreased MEK1 levels and to increased RAF/MEK/ERK pathway 
      activation. Such mice died perinatally due to tracheal growth restriction and 
      respiratory failure. Hence, a single miRNA can stimulate the production of an 
      inhibitory component of a central signaling pathway to impair cartilage development.

AB  - The conventional strategy for cancer gene therapy offers limited control of 
      specificity and efficacy. A possible way to overcome these limitations is to 
      construct logic circuits. Here we present modular AND gate circuits based on 
      CRISPR-Cas9 system. The circuits integrate cellular information from two promoters 
      as inputs and activate the output gene only when both inputs are active in the 
      tested cell lines. Using the luciferase reporter as the output gene, we show that 
      the circuit specifically detects bladder cancer cells and significantly enhances 
      luciferase expression in comparison to the human telomerase reverse 
      transcriptase-renilla luciferase construct. We also test the modularity of the 
      design by replacing the output with other cellular functional genes including hBAX, 
      p21 and E-cadherin. The circuits effectively inhibit bladder cancer cell growth, 
      induce apoptosis and decrease cell motility by regulating the corresponding gene. 
      This approach provides a synthetic biology platform for targeting and controlling 
      bladder cancer cells in vitro.

TI  - NFATC3 promotes IRF7 transcriptional activity in plasmacy--toid dendritic cells.
PG  - 2383-2398
AB  - Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) rapidly produce large amounts of type 1 
      interferon (IFN) after Toll-like receptor 7 and 9 engagements. This specialized 
      function of type 1 IFN production is directly linked to the constitutive expression 
      of IRF7, the master transcription factor for type 1 IFN production. However, the 
      IRF7 regulatory network in pDCs remains largely unknown. In this study, we identify 
      that the transcription factor NFATC3 specifically binds to IRF7 and enhances 
      IRF7-mediated IFN production. Furthermore, knockout of NFATC3 greatly reduced the 
      CpG DNA-induced nuclear translocation of IRF7, which resulted in impaired type 1 IFN 
      production in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we found that NFATC3 and IRF7 both 
      bound to type 1 IFN promoters and that the NFAT binding site in IFN promoters was 
      required for IRF7-mediated IFN expression. Collectively, our study shows that the 
      transcription factor NFATC3 binds to IRF7 and functions synergistically to enhance 
      IRF7-mediated IFN expression in pDCs.

TI  - Large-scale identification and functional analysis of NLR genes in blast resistance 
      in the Tetep rice genome sequence.
PG  - 18479-18487
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1910229116 [doi]
AB  - Tetep is a rice cultivar known for broad-spectrum resistance to blast, a devastating 
      fungal disease. The molecular basis for its broad-spectrum resistance is still 
      poorly understood. Is it because Tetep has many more NLR genes than other cultivars? 
      Or does Tetep possess multiple major NLR genes that can individually confer 
      broad-spectrum resistance to blast? Moreover, are there many interacting NLR pairs 
      in the Tetep genome? We sequenced its genome, obtained a high-quality assembly, and 
      annotated 455 nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes. We cloned and 
      tested 219 NLR genes as transgenes in 2 susceptible cultivars using 5 to 12 
      diversified pathogen strains; in many cases, fewer than 12 strains were successfully 
      cultured for testing. Ninety cloned NLRs showed resistance to 1 or more pathogen 
      strains and each strain was recognized by multiple NLRs. However, few NLRs showed 
      resistance to >6 strains, so multiple NLRs are apparently required for Tetep's 
      broad-spectrum resistance to blast. This was further supported by the pedigree 
      analyses, which suggested a correlation between resistance and the number of 
      Tetep-derived NLRs. In developing a method to identify NLR pairs each of which 
      functions as a unit, we found that >20% of the NLRs in the Tetep and 3 other rice 
      genomes are paired. Finally, we designed an extensive set of molecular markers for 
      rapidly introducing clustered and paired NLRs in the Tetep genome for breeding new 
      resistant cultivars. This study increased our understanding of the genetic basis of 
      broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice.

AB  - The most highly studied endocytic pathway, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, mediates 
      a wide range of fundamental processes including nutrient internalization, receptor 
      recycling, and signal transduction. In order to model tissue specific and 
      developmental aspects of this process, CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing was utilized to 
      fluorescently label the C-terminus of clathrin light chain A (CLTA) within the 
      phenotypically normal, parental CRMi001-A human induced pluripotent stem cell line. 
      Successfully edited cells were isolated by fluorescently activated cell sorting, 
      remained karyotypically normal, and maintained their differentiation potential. This 
      cell line facilitates imaging of endogenous clathrin trafficking within varied cell 
      types.

TI  - hVFL3/CCDC61 is a component of mother centriole subdistal appendages required for 
      centrosome cohesion and positioning.
PG  - 22-37
LID - 10.1111/boc.201900038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The centrosome regulates cell spatial organisation by controlling the 
      architecture of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. Conversely, the position of the 
      centrosome within the cell depends on cytoskeletal networks it helps organizing. In 
      mammalian cells, centrosome positioning involves a population of MT stably anchored 
      at centrioles, the core components of the centrosome. An MT-anchoring complex 
      containing the proteins ninein and Cep170 is enriched at subdistal appendages (SAP) 
      that decorate the older centriole (called mother centriole) and at centriole 
      proximal ends. Here, we studied the role played at the centrosome by hVFL3/CCDC61, 
      the human ortholog of proteins required for anchoring distinct sets of cytoskeletal 
      fibres to centrioles in unicellular eukaryotes. RESULTS: We show that hVFL3 
      co-localises at SAP and at centriole proximal ends with components of the 
      MT-anchoring complex, and physically interacts with Cep170. Depletion of hVFL3 
      increased the distance between mother and daughter centrioles without affecting the 
      assembly of a filamentous linker that tethers the centrioles and contains the 
      proteins rootletin and C-Nap1. When the linker was disrupted by inactivating C-Nap1, 
      hVFL3-depletion exacerbated centriole splitting, a phenotype also observed following 
      depletion of other SAP components. This supported that hVFL3 is required for SAP 
      function, which we further established by showing that centrosome positioning is 
      perturbed in hVFL3-depleted interphase cells. Finally, we found that hVFL3 is an 
      MT-binding protein. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our results support that 
      hVFL3 is required for anchoring MT at SAP during interphase and ensuring proper 
      centrosome cohesion and positioning. The role of the VFL3 family of proteins thus 
      appears to have been conserved in evolution despite the great variation in the shape 
      of centriole appendages in different eukaryotic species.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Knockout of the Neuropsychiatric Risk Gene KCTD13 Causes 
      Developmental Deficits in Human Cortical Neurons Derived from Induced Pluripotent 
      Stem Cells.
PG  - 616-634
LID - 10.1007/s12035-019-01727-1 [doi]
AB  - The human KCTD13 gene is located within the 16p11.2 locus and copy number variants 
      of this locus are associated with a high risk for neuropsychiatric diseases 
      including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Studies in zebrafish point to 
      a role of KCTD13 in proliferation of neural precursor cells which may contribute to 
      macrocephaly in 16p11.2 deletion carriers. KCTD13 is highly expressed in the fetal 
      human brain and in mouse cortical neurons, but its contribution to the development 
      and function of mammalian neurons is not completely understood. In the present 
      study, we deleted the KCTD13 gene in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
      using CRISPR/Cas9 nickase. Following neural differentiation of KCTD13 deficient and 
      isogenic control iPSC lines, we detected a moderate but significant inhibition of 
      DNA synthesis and proliferation in KCTD13 deficient human neural precursor cells. 
      KCTD13 deficient cortical neurons derived from iPSCs showed decreased neurite 
      formation and reduced spontaneous network activity. RNA-sequencing and pathway 
      analysis pointed to a role for ERBB signaling in these phenotypic changes. 
      Consistently, activating and inhibiting ERBB kinases rescued and aggravated, 
      respectively, impaired neurite formation. In contrast to findings in non-neuronal 
      human HeLa cells, we did not detect an accumulation of the putative KCTD13/Cullin-3 
      substrate RhoA, and treatment with inhibitors of RhoA signaling did not rescue 
      decreased neurite formation in human KCTD13 knockout neurons. Taken together, our 
      data provide insight into the role of KCTD13 in neurodevelopmental disorders, and 
      point to ERBB signaling as a potential target for neuropsychiatric disorders 
      associated with KCTD13 deficiency.

TI  - A complex between phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα and integrin α3β1 is required 
      for N-glycan sialylation in cancer cells.
PG  - 4425-4436
LID - 10.1074/jbc.RA118.005208 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant N-glycan sialylation of glycoproteins is closely associated with malignant 
      phenotypes of cancer cells and metastatic potential, which includes cell adhesion, 
      migration, and growth. Recently, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα), which 
      is localized to the trans-Golgi network, was identified as a regulator of Golgi 
      phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) and of vesicle transport in the Golgi apparatus. GOLPH3 is 
      a target of PI4KIIα and helps anchor sialyltransferases and thereby regulates 
      sialylation of cell surface receptors. However, how PI4KIIα-mediated sialyation of 
      cell surface proteins is regulated remains unclear. In this study, using several 
      cell lines, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout and short hairpin RNA-mediated 
      silencing, RT-PCR, lentivirus-mediated overexpression, and immunoblotting methods, 
      we confirmed that PI4KIIα knockdown suppresses the sialylation of N-glycans on the 
      cell surface, in Akt phosphorylation and activation, and integrin α3-mediated cell 
      migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, both integrin α3β1 and 
      PI4KIIα co-localized to the trans-Golgi network, where they physically interacted 
      with each other, and PI4KIIα specifically associated with integrin α3 but not α5. 
      Furthermore, overexpression of both integrin α3β1 and PI4KIIα induced 
      hypersialylation. Conversely, integrin α3 knockout significantly inhibited the 
      sialylation of membrane proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, as 
      well as in total cell lysates. These findings suggest that the malignant phenotype 
      of cancer cells is affected by a sialylation mechanism that is regulated by a 
      complex between PI4KIIα and integrin α3β1.

AB  - Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis triggers the ER stress 
      response (also known as Unfolded Protein Response), a hallmark of many pathological 
      disorders. However the connection between ER stress and inflammation remains largely 
      unexplored. Recent data suggest that ER stress controls the activity of 
      inflammasomes, key signaling platforms that mediate innate immune responses. Here we 
      report that expression of NLRP1, a core inflammasome component, is specifically 
      up-regulated during severe ER stress conditions in human cell lines. Both IRE1α and 
      PERK, but not the ATF6 pathway, modulate NLRP1 gene expression. Furthermore, using 
      mutagenesis, chromatin immunoprecipitation and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing 
      technology, we demonstrate that ATF4 transcription factor directly binds to NLRP1 
      promoter during ER stress. Although involved in different types of inflammatory 
      responses, XBP-1 splicing was not required for NLRP1 induction. This study provides 
      further evidence that links ER stress with innate.

AB  - The canonical functions of Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are indispensable for 
      protein synthesis. However, recent evidence indicates that some AARSs possess 
      additional biological functions (noncanonical functions) related to immune responses 
      and vascular development. Here, we identified a zebrafish cq16 mutant presenting the 
      disorganized vessels with abnormal branching of the established intersegmental 
      vessels (ISVs) as well as aberrant patterning of the brain vascular network after 50 
      h post fertilization. The cq16 mutant gene is responsible for encoding threonyl-tRNA 
      synthetase (tars) with a missense mutation. The abnormal branching of ISVs was 
      caused by the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (vegfa) 
      in tars(cq16) mutant. Inhibition of Vegf signaling suppresses the abnormal vascular 
      branching observed in tars(cq16) mutant. Furthermore, injection of human TARS mRNA 
      potently reduced the vascular aberrant branching in tars(cq16) mutant, indicating a 
      conserved function of tars in regulating angiogenesis between zebrafish and human. 
      Therefore, we conclude that noncanonical function of tars regulates vascular 
      development presumably by modulating the expression of vegfa.

TI  - Engineering Escherichia coli for malate production by integrating modular pathway 
      characterization with CRISPRi-guided multiplexed metabolic tuning.
PG  - 661-672
LID - 10.1002/bit.26486 [doi]
AB  - The application of rational design in reallocating metabolic flux to overproduce 
      desired chemicals is always restricted by the native regulatory network. Here, we 
      demonstrated that in vitro modular pathway optimization combined with in vivo 
      multiplexed combinatorial engineering enables effective characterization of the 
      bottleneck of a complex biosynthetic cascade and improves the output of the 
      engineered pathway. As a proof of concept, we systematically identified the 
      rate-limiting step of a five-gene malate biosynthetic pathway by combinatorially 
      tuning the enzyme loads of a reconstituted biocatalytic reaction in a cell-free 
      system. Using multiplexed CRISPR interference, we subsequently eliminated the 
      metabolic constraints by rationally assigning an optimal gene expression pattern for 
      each pathway module. The present engineered strain Escherichia coli B0013-47 
      exhibited a 2.3-fold increase in malate titer compared with that of the parental 
      strain, with a yield of 0.85 mol/mol glucose in shake-flask culture and titer of 
      269 mM (36 g/L) in fed-batch cultivation. The strategy reported herein represents a 
      powerful method for improving the efficiency of multi-gene pathways and advancing 
      the success of metabolic engineering.

AB  - To interrogate genes essential for cell growth, proliferation and survival in human 
      cells, we carried out a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas9 screen in a B-cell lymphoma line using a custom 
      extended-knockout (EKO) library of 278,754 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that targeted 
      19,084 RefSeq genes, 20,852 alternatively spliced exons, and 3,872 hypothetical 
      genes. A new statistical analysis tool called robust analytics and normalization for 
      knockout screens (RANKS) identified 2,280 essential genes, 234 of which were unique. 
      Individual essential genes were validated experimentally and linked to ribosome 
      biogenesis and stress responses. Essential genes exhibited a bimodal distribution 
      across 10 different cell lines, consistent with a continuous variation in 
      essentiality as a function of cell type. Genes essential in more lines had more 
      severe fitness defects and encoded the evolutionarily conserved structural cores of 
      protein complexes, whereas genes essential in fewer lines formed context-specific 
      modules and encoded subunits at the periphery of essential complexes. The 
      essentiality of individual protein residues across the proteome correlated with 
      evolutionary conservation, structural burial, modular domains, and protein 
      interaction interfaces. Many alternatively spliced exons in essential genes were 
      dispensable and were enriched for disordered regions. Fitness defects were observed 
      for 44 newly evolved hypothetical reading frames. These results illuminate the 
      contextual nature and evolution of essential gene functions in human cells.

TI  - A module for Rac temporal signal integration revealed with optogenetics.

AB  - Sensory systems use adaptation to measure changes in signaling inputs rather than 
      absolute levels of signaling inputs. Adaptation enables eukaryotic cells to 
      directionally migrate over a large dynamic range of chemoattractant. Because of 
      complex feedback interactions and redundancy, it has been difficult to define the 
      portion or portions of eukaryotic chemotactic signaling networks that generate 
      adaptation and identify the regulators of this process. In this study, we use a 
      combination of optogenetic intracellular inputs, CRISPR-based knockouts, and 
      pharmacological perturbations to probe the basis of neutrophil adaptation. We find 
      that persistent, optogenetically driven phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate 
      (PIP(3)) production results in only transient activation of Rac, a hallmark feature 
      of adaptive circuits. We further identify the guanine nucleotide exchange factor 
      P-Rex1 as the primary PIP(3)-stimulated Rac activator, whereas actin polymerization 
      and the GTPase-activating protein ArhGAP15 are essential for proper Rac turnoff. 
      This circuit is masked by feedback and redundancy when chemoattractant is used as 
      the input, highlighting the value of probing signaling networks at intermediate 
      nodes to deconvolve complex signaling cascades.

AB  - In humans, ciliary dysfunction causes ciliopathies, which present as multiple organ 
      defects, including developmental and sensory abnormalities. Sdccag8 is a 
      centrosomal/basal body protein essential for proper cilia formation. Gene mutations 
      in SDCCAG8 have been found in patients with ciliopathies manifesting a broad 
      spectrum of symptoms, including hypogonadism. Among these mutations, several that 
      are predicted to truncate the SDCCAG8 carboxyl (C)-terminus are also associated with 
      such symptoms; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the 
      present study, we identified the Sdccag8 C-terminal region (Sdccag8-C) as a module 
      that interacts with the ciliopathy proteins, Ick/Cilk1 and Mak, which were shown to 
      be essential for the regulation of ciliary protein trafficking and cilia length in 
      mammals in our previous studies. We found that Sdccag8-C is essential for Sdccag8 
      localization to centrosomes and cilia formation in cultured cells. We then generated 
      a mouse mutant in which Sdccag8-C was truncated (Sdccag8(ΔC/ΔC) mice) using a 
      CRISPR-mediated stop codon knock-in strategy. In Sdccag8(ΔC/ΔC) mice, we observed 
      abnormalities in cilia formation and ciliopathy-like organ phenotypes, including 
      cleft palate, polydactyly, retinal degeneration, and cystic kidney, which partially 
      overlapped with those previously observed in Ick- and Mak-deficient mice. 
      Furthermore, Sdccag8(ΔC/ΔC) mice exhibited a defect in spermatogenesis, which was a 
      previously uncharacterized phenotype of Sdccag8 dysfunction. Together, these results 
      shed light on the molecular and pathological mechanisms underlying ciliopathies 
      observed in patients with SDCCAG8 mutations, and may advance our understanding of 
      protein-protein interaction networks involved in cilia development.

TI  - Development and application of a recombination-based library versus library high- 
      throughput yeast two-hybrid (RLL-Y2H) screening system.
PG  - e17

AB  - Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network maintains proper function of all 
      organisms. Simple high-throughput technologies are desperately needed to delineate 
      the landscape of PPI networks. While recent state-of-the-art yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 
      systems improved screening efficiency, either individual colony isolation, library 
      preparation arrays, gene barcoding or massive sequencing are still required. Here, 
      we developed a recombination-based 'library vs library' Y2H system (RLL-Y2H), by 
      which multi-library screening can be accomplished in a single pool without any 
      individual treatment. This system is based on the phiC31 integrase-mediated 
      integration between bait and prey plasmids. The integrated fragments were digested 
      by MmeI and subjected to deep sequencing to decode the interaction matrix. We 
      applied this system to decipher the trans-kingdom interactome between Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis and host cells and further identified Rv2427c interfering with the 
      phagosome-lysosome fusion. This concept can also be applied to other systems to 
      screen protein-RNA and protein-DNA interactions and delineate signaling landscape in 
      cells.

AB  - The real value of gas-fermenting clostridia, capable of using CO and CO(2), resides 
      in their potential of being developed into cell factories to produce various bulk 
      chemicals and fuels. This process requires rapid chromosomal integration of 
      heterologous chemical biosynthetic pathways, which is impeded by the absence of 
      genetic tools competent for efficient genome engineering in these anaerobes. Here, 
      we developed a phage serine integrase-mediated site-specific genome engineering 
      technique in Clostridium ljungdahlii, one of the major acetogenic gas-fermenting 
      microbes. Two heterologous phage attachment/integration (Att/Int) systems (from 
      Clostridium difficile and Streptomyces) were introduced into C. ljungdahlii and 
      proven to be highly active, achieving efficient chromosomal integration of a whole 
      donor vector via single-crossover recombination. Based on this, we further realized 
      markerless chromosomal integration of target DNA fragments through a "dual integrase 
      cassette exchange" (DICE) strategy with the assistance of the CRISPR-Cas9 editing 
      system. As a proof of concept, a butyric acid production pathway from Clostridium 
      acetobutylicum was integrated into the C. ljungdahlii genome without the 
      introduction of extra markers, enabling stable expression of the pathway genes. The 
      resulting engineered strain produced 1.01 g/L of butyric acid within 3 days by 
      fermenting synthesis gas (CO(2)/CO). More importantly, the engineered strain showed 
      good genetic stability and maintained butyric acid production ability after 
      continuous subculturing. The system developed in this study overcomes the 
      deficiencies of currently available genetic tools in the chromosomal integration of 
      large DNA fragments (rapid, markerless and stable) in C. ljungdahlii, and may be 
      extended to other Clostridium species.

AB  - In the adaptive immune systems of many bacteria and archaea, the Cas9 endonuclease 
      forms a complex with specific guide/scaffold RNA to identify and cleave 
      complementary target sequences in foreign DNA. This DNA targeting machinery has been 
      exploited in numerous applications of genome editing and transcription control. 
      However, the molecular mechanism of the Cas9 system is still obscure. Recently, 
      high-resolution structures have been solved for Cas9 in different structural forms 
      (e.g., unbound forms, RNA-bound binary complexes, and RNA-DNA-bound tertiary 
      complexes, corresponding to an inactive state, a pre-target-bound state, and a 
      cleavage-competent or product state), which offered key structural insights to the 
      Cas9 mechanism. To further probe the structural dynamics of Cas9 interacting with 
      RNA and DNA at the amino-acid level of details, we have performed systematic 
      coarse-grained modeling using an elastic network model and related analyses. Our 
      normal mode analysis predicted a few key modes of collective motions that capture 
      the observed conformational changes featuring large domain motions triggered by 
      binding of RNA and DNA. Our flexibility analysis identified specific regions with 
      high or low flexibility that coincide with key functional sites (such as 
      DNA/RNA-binding sites, nuclease cleavage sites, and key hinges). We also identified 
      a small set of hotspot residues that control the energetics of functional motions, 
      which overlap with known functional sites and offer promising targets for future 
      mutagenesis efforts to improve the specificity of Cas9. Finally, we modeled the 
      conformational transitions of Cas9 from the unbound form to the binary complex and 
      then the tertiary complex, and predicted a distinct sequence of domain motions. In 
      sum, our findings have offered rich structural and dynamic details relevant to the 
      Cas9 machinery, and will guide future investigation and engineering of the Cas9 
      systems. Proteins 2017; 85:342-353. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The identification of molecular networks at the system level in mammals is 
      accelerated by next-generation mammalian genetics without crossing, which requires 
      both the efficient production of whole-body biallelic knockout (KO) mice in a single 
      generation and high-performance phenotype analyses. Here, we show that the triple 
      targeting of a single gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system achieves almost perfect KO 
      efficiency (96%-100%). In addition, we developed a respiration-based fully automated 
      non-invasive sleep phenotyping system, the Snappy Sleep Stager (SSS), for 
      high-performance (95.3% accuracy) sleep/wake staging. Using the triple-target CRISPR 
      and SSS in tandem, we reliably obtained sleep/wake phenotypes, even in double-KO 
      mice. By using this system to comprehensively analyze all of the 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor family members, we found Nr3a as a 
      short-sleeper gene, which is verified by an independent set of triple-target CRISPR. 
      These results demonstrate the application of mammalian reverse genetics without 
      crossing to organism-level systems biology in sleep research.

AB  - The ability to manipulate the expression of mammalian genes using synthetic 
      transcription factors is highly desirable in both fields of basic research and 
      industry for diverse applications, including stem cell reprogramming and 
      differentiation, tissue engineering, and drug discovery. Orthogonal CRISPR systems 
      can be used for simultaneous transcriptional upregulation of a subset of target 
      genes while downregulating another subset, thus gaining control of gene regulatory 
      networks, signaling pathways, and cellular processes whose activity depends on the 
      expression of multiple genes. We have used a rapid and efficient modular cloning 
      system to build and test in parallel diverse CRISPRa and CRISPRi systems and develop 
      an efficient orthogonal gene regulation system for multiplexed and simultaneous up- 
      and downregulation of endogenous target genes.

TI  - Characterization of the human GnRH neuron developmental transcriptome using a 
      GNRH1-TdTomato reporter line in human pluripotent stem cells.

AB  - Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons provide a fundamental signal for the 
      onset of puberty and subsequent reproductive functions by secretion of 
      gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Their disrupted development or function leads to 
      congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH). To model the development of human 
      GnRH neurons, we generated a stable GNRH1-TdTomato reporter cell line in human 
      pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. RNA-sequencing of 
      the reporter clone, differentiated into GnRH neurons by dual SMAD inhibition and 
      FGF8 treatment, revealed 6461 differentially expressed genes between progenitors and 
      GnRH neurons. Expression of the transcription factor ISL1, one of the top 50 most 
      upregulated genes in the TdTomato-expressing GnRH neurons, was confirmed in 10.5 
      gestational week-old human fetal GnRH neurons. Among the differentially expressed 
      genes, we detected 15 genes that are implicated in CHH and several genes that are 
      implicated in human puberty timing. Finally, FGF8 treatment in the neuronal 
      progenitor pool led to upregulation of 37 genes expressed both in progenitors and in 
      TdTomato-expressing GnRH neurons, which suggests upstream regulation of these genes 
      by FGF8 signaling during GnRH neuron differentiation. These results illustrate how 
      hPSC-derived human GnRH neuron transcriptomic analysis can be utilized to dissect 
      signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks involved in human GnRH neuron 
      development.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first

AB  - Rhythmic animal behaviors are regulated in part by neural circuits called the 
      central pattern generators (CPGs). Classifying neural population activities 
      correlated with body movements and identifying the associated component neurons are 
      critical steps in understanding CPGs. Previous methods that classify neural dynamics 
      obtained by dimension reduction algorithms often require manual optimization which 
      could be laborious and preparation-specific. Here, we present a simpler and more 
      flexible method that is based on the pre-trained convolutional neural network model 
      VGG-16 and unsupervised learning, and successfully classifies the fictive motor 
      patterns in Drosophila larvae under various imaging conditions. We also used 
      voxel-wise correlation mapping to identify neurons associated with motor patterns. 
      By applying these methods to neurons targeted by 5-HT2A-GAL4, which we generated by 
      the CRISPR/Cas9-system, we identified two classes of interneurons, termed Seta and 
      Leta, which are specifically active during backward but not forward fictive 
      locomotion. Optogenetic activation of Seta and Leta neurons increased backward 
      locomotion. Conversely, thermogenetic inhibition of 5-HT2A-GAL4 neurons or 
      application of a 5-HT2 antagonist decreased backward locomotion induced by noxious 
      light stimuli. This study establishes an accelerated pipeline for activity profiling 
      and cell identification in larval Drosophila and implicates the serotonergic system 
      in the modulation of backward locomotion.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells arise from mesoderm-derived hemogenic endothelium (HE) 
      during embryogenesis in a process termed endothelial-hematopoietic transition (EHT). 
      To better understand the gene networks that control this process, we investigated 
      the role of the transcription factor HEB (TCF12) by disrupting the TCF12 gene locus 
      in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and inducing them to differentiate toward 
      hematopoietic outcomes. HEB-deficient hESCs retained key features of pluripotency, 
      including expression of SOX2 and SSEA-4 and teratoma formation, while NANOG 
      expression was reduced. Differentiation of HEB(-/-) hESCs toward hematopoietic fates 
      revealed a severe defect in mesodermal development accompanied by decreased 
      expression of regulators of mesoendodermal fate choices. We also identified 
      independent defects in HE formation at the molecular and cellular levels, as well as 
      a failure of T cell development. All defects were largely rescued by re-expression 
      of HEB. Taken together, our results identify HEB as a critical regulator of human 
      mesodermal and hematopoietic specification.

PG  - 343-346
LID - 10.6026/97320630013343 [doi]
AB  - Lubricin is a synovial glycoprotein that contributes to joint lubrication. We 
      propose the hypothesis that lubricin is a key modulator of the 
      psychoneuroendocrine-osteoimmune interactome, with important clinical relevance for 
      osteoarthritic pathologies. We consider a variety of neuroendocrine-immune factors, 
      including inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the 
      modulation of lubricin in rheumatic complications. Based on our preliminary 
      immunocytochemistry and fractal analysis data, and in the context of translational 
      research of modern healthcare, we propose that molecular lubricin gene expression 
      modification by means of the novel CRISPR/Cas system be considered for 
      osteoarthritic therapies.

PG  - 444-448
AB  - Identifying functional elements and predicting mechanistic insight from non-coding 
      DNA and noncoding variation remains a challenge. Advances in genome-scale, 
      high-throughput technology, however, have brought these answers closer within reach 
      than ever, though there is still a need for new computational approaches to analysis 
      and integration. This workshop aims to explore these resources and new computational 
      methods applied to regulatory elements, chromatin interactions, non-protein-coding 
      genes, and other non-coding DNA.

TI  - Identification of the Transcriptional Networks and the Involvement in Angiotensin 
      II-Induced Injury after CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Knockdown of Cyr61 in HEK293T Cells.
PG  - 8697257

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transcriptional networks of Cyr61 and its function in cell injury 
      are poorly understood. The present study depicted the lncRNA and mRNA profiles and 
      the involvement in angiotensin II-induced injury after Cyr61 knockdown mediated by 
      CRISPR/Cas9 in HEK293T cells. METHODS: HEK293T cells were cultured, and Cyr61 
      knockdown was achieved by transfection of the CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmid. lncRNA and 
      mRNA microarrays were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene 
      ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
      analyses were performed to determine biofunctions and signaling pathways. RT-PCR was 
      used to validate the microarray results. Cells were divided into four groups: 
      control, Cyr61 knockdown, angiotensin II (Ang II) without Cyr61 knockdown, and Ang 
      II with Cyr61 knockdown. CCK8, western blotting, and flow cytometry analysis were 
      carried out to dissect cellular function. RESULTS: A total of 23184 lncRNAs and 
      28264 mRNAs were normalized. 26 lncRNAs and 212 mRNAs were upregulated, and 74 
      lncRNAs and 233 mRNAs were downregulated after Cyr61 knockdown. Analysis of cellular 
      components, molecular functions, biological processes, and regulatory pathways 
      associated with the differentially expressed mRNAs revealed downstream mechanisms of 
      the Cyr61 gene. The differentially expressed genes were affected for small cell lung 
      cancer, axon guidance, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, MAPK signaling pathway, 
      focal adhesion, insulin resistance, and metabolic pathways. In addition, Cyr61 
      expression was increased in accordance with induction of cell cycle arrest and 
      apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation induced by Ang II. Knockdown of Cyr61 
      in HEK293T cells promoted cell cycle procession, decreased apoptosis, and promoted 
      cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The Cyr61 gene is involved in Ang II-induced injury 
      in HEK293T cells. Functional mechanisms of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and 
      mRNAs as well as identification of metabolic pathways will provide new therapeutic 
      targets for Cyr61-realated diseases.

TI  - Epidermal differentiation gene regulatory networks controlled by MAF and MAFB.
PG  - 1405-9

AB  - Numerous regulatory factors in epidermal differentiation and their role in 
      regulating different cell states have been identified in recent years. However, the 
      genetic interactions between these regulators over the dynamic course of 
      differentiation have not been studied. In this Extra-View article, we review recent 
      work by Lopez-Pajares et al. that explores a new regulatory network in epidermal 
      differentiation. They analyze the changing transcriptome throughout epidermal 
      regeneration to identify 3 separate gene sets enriched in the progenitor, early and 
      late differentiation states. Using expression module mapping, MAF along with MAFB, 
      are identified as transcription factors essential for epidermal differentiation. 
      Through double knock-down of MAF:MAFB using siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout, 
      epidermal differentiation was shown to be impaired both in-vitro and in-vivo, 
      confirming MAF:MAFB's role to activate genes that drive differentiation. 
      Lopez-Pajares and collaborators integrated 42 published regulator gene sets and the 
      MAF:MAFB gene set into the dynamic differentiation gene expression landscape and 
      found that lncRNAs TINCR and ANCR act as upstream regulators of MAF:MAFB. 
      Furthermore, ChIP-seq analysis of MAF:MAFB identified key transcription factor genes 
      linked to epidermal differentiation as downstream effectors. Combined, these 
      findings illustrate a dynamically regulated network with MAF:MAFB as a crucial link 
      for progenitor gene repression and differentiation gene activation.

TI  - DYRK1A regulates the recruitment of 53BP1 to the sites of DNA damage in part through 
      interaction with RNF169.
PG  - 531-551
LID - 10.1080/15384101.2019.1577525 [doi]
AB  - Human Dual-specificity tyrosine (Y) Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is encoded by a 
      dosage dependent gene whereby either trisomy or haploinsufficiency result in 
      developmental abnormalities. However, the function and regulation of this important 
      protein kinase are not fully understood. Here, we report proteomic analysis of 
      DYRK1A in human cells that revealed a novel role of DYRK1A in DNA double-strand 
      breaks (DSBs) repair, mediated in part by its interaction with the ubiquitin-binding 
      protein RNF169 that accumulates at the DSB sites and promotes homologous 
      recombination repair (HRR) by displacing 53BP1, a key mediator of non-homologous end 
      joining (NHEJ). We found that overexpression of active, but not the kinase inactive 
      DYRK1A in U-2 OS cells inhibits accumulation of 53BP1 at the DSB sites in the 
      RNF169-dependent manner. DYRK1A phosphorylates RNF169 at two sites that influence 
      its ability to displace 53BP1 from the DSBs. Although DYRK1A is not required for the 
      recruitment of RNF169 to the DSB sites and 53BP1 displacement, inhibition of DYRK1A 
      or mutation of the DYRK1A phosphorylation sites in RNF169 decreases its ability to 
      block accumulation of 53BP1 at the DSB sites. Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of 
      DYRK1A in human and mouse cells also diminished the 53BP1 DSB recruitment in a 
      manner that did not require RNF169, suggesting that dosage of DYRK1A can influence 
      the DNA repair processes through both RNF169-dependent and independent mechanisms. 
      Human U-2 OS cells devoid of DYRK1A display an increased HRR efficiency and 
      resistance to DNA damage, therefore our findings implicate DYRK1A in the DNA repair 
      processes.

TI  - Combined siRNA and Small-Molecule Phenotypic Screening Identifies Targets Regulating 
      Rhinovirus Replication in Primary Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 634-645
LID - 10.1177/2472555220909726 [doi]
AB  - Human rhinovirus (RV) is the most common cause of acute upper respiratory tract 
      infections and has recently been shown to play a significant role in exacerbations 
      of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is a significant 
      unmet medical need for agents for the prevention and/or treatment of exacerbations 
      triggered by human RV infection. Phenotypic drug discovery programs using different 
      perturbation modalities, for example, siRNA, small-molecule compounds, and CRISPR, 
      hold significant value for identifying novel drug targets. We have previously 
      reported the identification of lanosterol synthase as a novel regulator of RV2 
      replication through a phenotypic screen of a library of siRNAs against druggable 
      genes in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. Here, we describe a 
      follow-up phenotypic screen of small-molecule compounds that are annotated to be 
      pharmacological regulators of target genes that were identified to significantly 
      affect RV2 replication in the siRNA primary screen of 10,500 druggable genes. Two 
      hundred seventy small-molecule compounds selected for interacting with 122 target 
      gene hits were screened in the primary RV2 assay in NHBE cells by quantifying viral 
      replication via in situ hybridization followed by secondary quantitative PCR-based 
      assays for RV2, RV14, and RV16. The described follow-up phenotypic screening allowed 
      us to identify Fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) as a novel target regulating RV 
      replication. We demonstrate that a combination of siRNA and small-molecule compound 
      screening models is a useful phenotypic drug discovery approach for the 
      identification of novel drug targets.

TI  - Reversal of Cytosolic One-Carbon Flux Compensates for Loss of the Mitochondrial 
      Folate Pathway.

LID - 10.1016/j.cmet.2016.04.016 [doi]
AB  - One-carbon (1C) units for purine and thymidine synthesis can be generated from 
      serine by cytosolic or mitochondrial folate metabolism. The mitochondrial 1C pathway 
      is consistently overexpressed in cancer. Here, we show that most but not all 
      proliferating mammalian cell lines use the mitochondrial pathway as the default for 
      making 1C units. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR)-mediated mitochondrial pathway knockout activates cytosolic 1C-unit 
      production. This reversal in cytosolic flux is triggered by depletion of a single 
      metabolite, 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (10-formyl-THF), and enables rapid cell 
      growth in nutrient-replete conditions. Loss of the mitochondrial pathway, however, 
      renders cells dependent on extracellular serine to make 1C units and on 
      extracellular glycine to make glutathione. HCT-116 colon cancer xenografts lacking 
      mitochondrial 1C pathway activity generate the 1C units required for growth by 
      cytosolic serine catabolism. Loss of both pathways precludes xenograft formation. 
      Thus, either mitochondrial or cytosolic 1C metabolism can support tumorigenesis, 
      with the mitochondrial pathway required in nutrient-poor conditions.

AB  - The CXCR3-CXCL11 chemokine-signaling axis plays an essential role in infection and 
      inflammation by orchestrating leukocyte trafficking in human and animal models, 
      including zebrafish. Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) play a fundamental 
      regulatory function in signaling networks by shaping chemokine gradients through 
      their ligand scavenging function, while being unable to signal in the classic 
      G-protein-dependent manner. Two copies of the CXCR3 gene in zebrafish, cxcr3.2 and 
      cxcr3.3, are expressed on macrophages and share a highly conserved ligand-binding 
      site. However, Cxcr3.3 has structural characteristics of ACKRs indicative of a 
      ligand-scavenging role. In contrast, we previously showed that Cxcr3.2 is an active 
      CXCR3 receptor because it is required for macrophage motility and recruitment to 
      sites of mycobacterial infection. In this study, we generated a cxcr3.3 
      CRISPR-mutant to functionally dissect the antagonistic interplay among the cxcr3 
      paralogs in the immune response. We observed that cxcr3.3 mutants are more 
      susceptible to mycobacterial infection, whereas cxcr3.2 mutants are more resistant. 
      Furthermore, macrophages in the cxcr3.3 mutant are more motile, show higher 
      activation status, and are recruited more efficiently to sites of infection or 
      injury. Our results suggest that Cxcr3.3 is an ACKR that regulates the activity of 
      Cxcr3.2 by scavenging common ligands and that silencing the scavenging function of 
      Cxcr3.3 results in an exacerbated Cxcr3.2 signaling. In human, splice variants of 
      CXCR3 have antagonistic functions and CXCR3 ligands also interact with ACKRs. 
      Therefore, in zebrafish, an analogous regulatory mechanism appears to have evolved 
      after the cxcr3 gene duplication event, through diversification of conventional and 
      atypical receptor variants.

AB  - Gene regulatory networks orchestrate the assembly of functionally related cells 
      within a cellular network. Subtle differences often exist among functionally related 
      cells within such networks. How differences are created among cells with similar 
      functions has been difficult to determine due to the complexity of both the gene and 
      the cellular networks. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the DD and VD motor neurons 
      compose a cross-inhibitory, GABAergic network that coordinates dorsal and ventral 
      muscle contractions during locomotion. The Pitx2 homologue, UNC-30, acts as a 
      terminal selector gene to create similarities and the Coup-TFII homologue, UNC-55, 
      is necessary for creating differences between the two motor neuron classes. What is 
      the organizing gene regulatory network responsible for initiating the expression of 
      UNC-55 and thus creating differences between the DD and VD motor neurons? We show 
      that the unc-55 promoter has modules that contain Meis/UNC-62 binding sites. These 
      sites can be subdivided into regions that are capable of activating or repressing 
      UNC-55 expression in different motor neurons. Interestingly, different isoforms of 
      UNC-62 are responsible for the activation and the stabilization of unc-55 
      transcription. Furthermore, specific isoforms of UNC-62 are required for proper 
      synaptic patterning of the VD motor neurons. Isoform specific regulation of 
      differentiating neurons is a relatively unexplored area of research and presents a 
      mechanism for creating differences among functionally related cells within a 
      network.

TI  - Noncoding somatic and inherited single-nucleotide variants converge to promote ESR1 
      expression in breast cancer.
PG  - 1260-6
LID - 10.1038/ng.3650 [doi]
AB  - Sustained expression of the estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) drives two-thirds of breast 
      cancer and defines the ESR1-positive subtype. ESR1 engages enhancers upon estrogen 
      stimulation to establish an oncogenic expression program. Somatic copy number 
      alterations involving the ESR1 gene occur in approximately 1% of ESR1-positive 
      breast cancers, suggesting that other mechanisms underlie the persistent expression 
      of ESR1. We report significant enrichment of somatic mutations within the set of 
      regulatory elements (SRE) regulating ESR1 in 7% of ESR1-positive breast cancers. 
      These mutations regulate ESR1 expression by modulating transcription factor binding 
      to the DNA. The SRE includes a recurrently mutated enhancer whose activity is also 
      affected by rs9383590, a functional inherited single-nucleotide variant (SNV) that 
      accounts for several breast cancer risk-associated loci. Our work highlights the 
      importance of considering the combinatorial activity of regulatory elements as a 
      single unit to delineate the impact of noncoding genetic alterations on single genes 
      in cancer.

AB  - Thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13 (TRIP13) is an AAA(+)-ATPase that plays a key 
      role in mitotic checkpoint complex inactivation and is associated with the 
      progression of several cancers. However, its role in lung adenocarcinogenesis 
      remains unknown. Here, we report that TRIP13 is highly overexpressed in multiple 
      lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tumor tissues. Clinically, TRIP13 expression is 
      positively associated with tumor size, T-stage, and N-stage, and Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis revealed that heightened TRIP13 expression is associated with lower overall 
      survival. TRIP13 promotes lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and 
      migration while inhibiting apoptosis and G2/M phase shift in vitro. Accordingly, 
      TRIP13-silenced xenograft tumors displayed significant growth inhibition in vivo. 
      Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that TRIP13 interacts with a protein network 
      associated with dsDNA break repair and PI3K/Akt signaling. TRIP13 
      upregulatesAkt(Ser473) and downregulatesAkt(Thr308)/mTOR(Ser2448)activity, which 
      suppresses accurate dsDNA break repair. TRIP13 also downregulates pro-apoptotic 
      Bad(Ser136) and cleaved caspase-3 while upregulating survivin. In conclusion, 
      heightened TRIP13 expression appears to promote lung adenocarcinoma tumor 
      progression and displays potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker for lung 
      adenocarcinoma.

AB  - RNAi is broadly used to map gene regulatory networks, but the identification of 
      genes that are responsible for the observed phenotypes is challenging, as small 
      interfering RNAs (siRNAs) simultaneously downregulate the intended on targets and 
      many partially complementary off targets. Additionally, the scarcity of publicly 
      available control datasets hinders the development and comparative evaluation of 
      computational methods for analyzing the data. Here, we introduce PheLiM 
      (https://github.com/andreariba/PheLiM), a method that uses predictions of siRNA on- 
      and off-target downregulation to infer gene-specific contributions to phenotypes. 
      To assess the performance of PheLiM, we carried out siRNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-based 
      genome-wide screening of two well-characterized pathways, bone morphogenetic protein 
      (BMP) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and we reanalyzed publicly available siRNA 
      screens. We demonstrate that PheLiM has the overall highest accuracy and most 
      reproducible results compared to other available methods. PheLiM can accommodate 
      various methods for predicting siRNA off targets and is broadly applicable to the 
      identification of genes underlying complex phenotypes.

TI  - Ingenuity pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes involved in signaling 
      pathways and molecular networks in RhoE gene‑edited cardiomyocytes.
PG  - 1225-1238

AB  - RhoE/Rnd3 is an atypical member of the Rho superfamily of proteins, However, the 
      global biological function profile of this protein remains unsolved. In the present 
      study, a RhoE‑knockout H9C2 cardiomyocyte cell line was established using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology, following which differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      between the knockout and wild‑type cell lines were screened using whole genome 
      expression gene chips. A total of 829 DEGs, including 417 upregulated and 412 
      downregulated, were identified using the threshold of fold changes ≥1.2 and P<0.05. 
      Using the ingenuity pathways analysis system with a threshold of ‑Log (P‑value)>2, 
      67 canonical pathways were found to be enriched. Many of the detected signaling 
      pathways, including that of oncostatin M signaling, were found to be associated with 
      the inflammatory response. Subsequent disease and function analysis indicated that 
      apart from cardiovascular disease and development function, RhoE may also be 
      involved in other diseases and function, including organismal survival, cancer, 
      organismal injury and abnormalities, cell‑to‑cell signaling and interaction, and 
      molecular transport. In addition, 885 upstream regulators were enriched, including 
      59 molecules that were predicated to be strongly activated (Z‑score >2) and 
      60 molecules that were predicated to be significantly inhibited (Z‑scores <‑2). In 
      particular, 33 regulatory effects and 25 networks were revealed to be associated 
      with the DEGs. Among them, the most significant regulatory effects were 'adhesion of 
      endothelial cells' and 'recruitment of myeloid cells' and the top network was 
      'neurological disease', 'hereditary disorder, organismal injury and abnormalities'. 
      In conclusion, the present study successfully edited the RhoE gene in H9C2 cells 
      using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and subsequently analyzed the enriched DEGs along with 
      their associated canonical signaling pathways, diseases and functions 
      classification, upstream regulatory molecules, regulatory effects and interaction 
      networks. The results of the present study should facilitate the discovery of the 
      global biological and functional properties of RhoE and provide new insights into 
      role of RhoE in human diseases, especially those in the cardiovascular system.

TI  - The precise regulation of different COR genes by individual CBF transcription 
      factors in Arabidopsis thaliana.
PG  - 118-133
LID - 10.1111/jipb.12515 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factors CBF1/2/3 are reported to play a dominant role in the cold 
      responsive network of Arabidopsis by directly regulating the expression levels of 
      cold responsive (COR) genes. In this study, we obtained CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
      loss-of-function mutants of cbf1∼3. Over 3,000 COR genes identified by RNA-seq 
      analysis showed a slight but significant change in their expression levels in the 
      mutants compared to the wild-type plants after being treated at 4 °C for 12 h. The 
      C-repeat (CRT) motif (5'-CCGAC-3') was enriched in promoters of genes that were 
      up-regulated by CBF2 and CBF3 but not in promoters of genes up-regulated by CBF1. 
      These data suggest that CBF2 and CBF3 play a more important role in directing the 
      cold response by regulating different sets of downstream COR genes. More than 2/3 of 
      COR genes were co-regulated by two or three CBFs and were involved mainly in 
      cellular signal transduction and metabolic processes; less than 1/3 of the genes 
      were regulated by one CBF, and those genes up-regulated were enriched in 
      cold-related abiotic stress responses. Our results indicate that CBFs play an 
      important role in the trade-off between cold tolerance and plant growth through the 
      precise regulation of COR genes in the complicated transcriptional network.

TI  - Altered (neo-) lacto series glycolipid biosynthesis impairs α2-6 sialylation on 
      N-glycoproteins in ovarian cancer cells.
PG  - 45367
LID - 10.1038/srep45367 [doi]

AB  - The (neo-) lacto series glycosphingolipids (nsGSLs) comprise of glycan epitopes that 
      are present as blood group antigens, act as primary receptors for human pathogens 
      and are also increasingly associated with malignant diseases. Beta-1, 
      3-N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-transferase 5 (B3GNT5) is suggested as the key 
      glycosyltransferase for the biosynthesis of nsGSLs. In this study, we investigated 
      the impact of CRISPR-Cas9 -mediated gene disruption of B3GNT5 (∆B3GNT5) on the 
      expression of glycosphingolipids and N-glycoproteins by utilizing immunostaining and 
      glycomics-based PGC-UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS profiling. ∆B3GNT5 cells lost nsGSL 
      expression coinciding with reduction of α2-6 sialylation on N-glycoproteins. In 
      contrast, disruption of B4GALNT1, a glycosyltransferase for ganglio series GSLs did 
      not affect α2-6 sialylation on N-glycoproteins. We further profiled all known α2-6

AB  - Echinoderms display a vast array of pigmentation and patterning in larval and adult 
      life stages. This coloration is thought to be important for immune defense and 
      camouflage. However, neither the cellular nor molecular mechanism that regulates 
      this complex coloration in the adult is known. Here we knocked out three different 
      genes thought to be involved in the pigmentation pathway(s) of larvae and grew the 
      embryos to adulthood. The genes tested were polyketide synthase (PKS), 
      Flavin-dependent monooxygenase family 3 (FMO3) and glial cells missing (GCM). We 
      found that disabling of the PKS gene at fertilization resulted in albinism 
      throughout all life stages and throughout all cells and tissues of this animal, 
      including the immune cells of the coelomocytes. We also learned that FMO3 is an 
      essential modifier of the polyketide. FMO3 activity is essential for larval 
      pigmentation, but in juveniles and adults, loss of FMO3 activity resulted in the 
      animal becoming pastel purple. Linking the LC-MS analysis of this modified pigment 
      to a naturally purple animal suggested a conserved echinochrome profile yielding a 
      pastel purple. We interpret this result as FMO3 modifies the parent polyketide to 
      contribute to the normal brown/green color of the animal, and that in its absence, 
      other biochemical modifications are revealed, perhaps by other members of the large 
      FMO family in this animal. The FMO modularity revealed here may be important in the 
      evolutionary changes between species and for different immune challenges. We also 
      learned that glial cells missing (GCM), a key transcription factor of the 
      endomesoderm gene regulatory network of embryos in the sea urchin, is required for 
      pigmentation throughout the life stages of this sea urchin, but surprisingly, is not 
      essential for larval development, metamorphosis, or maintenance of adulthood. Mosaic 
      knockout of either PKS or GCM revealed spatial lineage commitment in the transition 
      from bilaterality of the larva to a pentaradial body plan of the adult. The cellular 
      lineages identified by pigment presence or absence (wild-type or knock-out lineages, 
      respectively) followed a strict oral/aboral profile. No circumferential segments 
      were seen and instead we observed 10-fold symmetry in the segments of pigment 
      expression. This suggests that the adult lineage commitments in the five outgrowths 
      of the hydropore in the larva are early, complete, fixed, and each bilaterally 
      symmetric. Overall, these results suggest that pigmentation of this animal is 
      genetically determined and dependent on a population of pigment stem cells that are 
      set-aside in a sub-region of each outgrowth of the pentaradial adult rudiment prior 
      to metamorphosis. This study reveals the complex chemistry of pigment applicable to 
      many organisms, and further, provides an insight into the key transitions from 
      bilateral to pentaradial body plans unique to echinoderms.

AB  - Neuronal migration and neurite growth are essential events in neural development, 
      but it remains unclear how guidance cues are transduced through receptors to the 
      actin cytoskeleton, which powers these processes. We report that a cytokinetic 
      scaffold protein, Anillin, is redistributed to the leading edge of the C. elegans Q 
      neuroblast during cell migration and neurite growth. To bypass the requirement for 
      Anillin in cytokinesis, we used the somatic CRISPR-Cas9 technique to generate 
      conditional mutations in Anillin. We demonstrate that Anillin regulates cell 
      migration and growth cone extension by stabilizing the F-actin network at the 
      leading edge. Our biochemical analysis shows that the actin-binding domain of 
      Anillin is sufficient to stabilize F-actin by antagonizing the F-actin severing 
      activity of Cofilin. We further uncover that the active form of RhoG/MIG-2 directly 
      binds to Anillin and recruits it to the leading edge. Our results reveal a novel 
      pathway in which Anillin transduces the RhoG signal to the actin cytoskeleton during 
      neuronal migration and neurite growth.

      lepr and mc4r].
PG  - 61-69
AB  - Obesity has become a severe public health problem across the world, and seriously 
      affects the health and life quality of human beings. Here we generated lepr and mc4r 
      mutant zebrafish via the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, and performed morphological and 
      functional characterizations of those mutants. We observed that there was no 
      significant phenotypic difference between homozygous mutants and wild-type controls 
      before 2.5 months post-fertilization (mpf). However, the adult lepr(-/-) and 
      mc4r(-/-) individuals displayed increased food intake, heavier weight, and higher 
      body fat percentage, the characteristics of obesity phenotypes. Blood glucose test 
      showed that overfeeding induced significantly impaired glucose tolerance in adult 
      lepr(-/-) and mc4r(-/-) zebrafish. Furthermore, we analyzed 76 energy 
      metabolism-related transcripts in lepr(-/-) and mc4r(-/-) zebrafish livers by using 
      real-time RT-PCR, and compared the results with the published microarray data of 
      Lep(ob/ob) mouse livers, and found that the changes in the expression of insulin/IGF 
      signaling (IIS) pathway genes in lepr(-/-) zebrafish and Lep(ob/ob) mouse were 
      positively correlated, suggesting that the IIS pathway maintains functional 
      conservation between zebrafish and mammals during the evolution of the 
      obesity-regulating molecule network.

AB  - Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is implicated in metastases formation and 
      acquired therapy resistance in several tumor entities. The two transcription factors 
      SNAIL1 and ZEB1 are thought to be master regulators of EMT and to form a core 
      regulatory network required for EMT-associated transcriptional reprogramming. Yet, 
      inducible EMT models show the sequential upregulation first of SNAIL1 and only 
      subsequently of ZEB1. Therefore, SNAIL1 and ZEB1 might be differentially needed for 
      the onset and propagation of EMT. Here we used LS174T colorectal adenocarcinoma 
      cells which do not express endogenous EMT-inducing transcription factors, to 
      investigate whether ZEB1 is an obligatory downstream mediator of Snail1-induced EMT, 
      and to test whether ZEB1 could elicit an EMT in a background of naïve epithelial 
      cells by itself. However, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ZEB1 did not affect the 
      ability of ectopically expressed Snail1 to trigger a complete EMT in ZEB1-deficient 
      LS174T cells. In contrast to Snail1, ectopic ZEB1 had only minor effects on cell 
      morphology and invasive growth in three-dimensional spheroid cultures. In agreement 
      with this, expression of ZEB1 did not lead to repression of epithelial marker genes, 
      and mesenchymal markers were not upregulated by ZEB1. Likewise, ectopic ZEB1 
      expression did not confer increased chemoresistance. We conclude that ZEB1 is 
      neither required nor sufficient for EMT in LS174T colorectal cancer cells.

TI  - PPM1A silences cytosolic RNA sensing and antiviral defense through direct 
      dephosphorylation of MAVS and TBK1.
PG  - e1501889

AB  - Cytosolic RNA sensing is a prerequisite for initiation of innate immune response 
      against RNA viral pathogens. Signaling through RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene 
      I)-like receptors (RLRs) to TBK1 (Tank-binding kinase 1)/IKKε (IκB kinase ε) kinases 
      is transduced by mitochondria-associated MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling 
      protein). However, the precise mechanism of how MAVS-mediated TBK1/IKKε activation 
      is strictly controlled still remains obscure. We reported that protein phosphatase 
      magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A; also known as PP2Cα), depending on its catalytic 
      ability, dampened the RLR-IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) axis to silence 
      cytosolic RNA sensing signaling. We demonstrated that PPM1A was an inherent partner 
      of the TBK1/IKKε complex, targeted both MAVS and TBK1/IKKε for dephosphorylation, 
      and thus disrupted MAVS-driven formation of signaling complex. Conversely, a high 
      level of MAVS can dissociate the TBK1/PPM1A complex to override PPM1A-mediated 
      inhibition. Loss of PPM1A through gene ablation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells 
      and mouse primary macrophages enabled robustly enhanced antiviral responses. 
      Consequently, Ppm1a(-/-) mice resisted to RNA virus attack, and transgenic zebrafish 
      expressing PPM1A displayed profoundly increased RNA virus vulnerability. These 
      findings identify PPM1A as the first known phosphatase of MAVS and elucidate the 
      physiological function of PPM1A in antiviral immunity on whole animals.

TI  - Antagonistic BMP-cWNT signaling in the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis reveals 
      insight into the evolution of mesoderm.
PG  - E5608-E5615
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1701607114 [doi]
AB  - Gastrulation was arguably the key evolutionary innovation that enabled metazoan 
      diversification, leading to the formation of distinct germ layers and specialized 
      tissues. Differential gene expression specifying cell fate is governed by the inputs 
      of intracellular and/or extracellular signals. Beta-catenin/Tcf and the TGF-beta 
      bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) provide critical molecular signaling inputs during 
      germ layer specification in bilaterian metazoans, but there has been no direct 
      experimental evidence for a specific role for BMP signaling during endomesoderm 
      specification in the early branching metazoan Nematostella vectensis (an anthozoan 
      cnidarian). Using forward transcriptomics, we show that beta-catenin/Tcf signaling 
      and BMP2/4 signaling provide differential inputs into the cnidarian endomesodermal 
      gene regulatory network (GRN) at the onset of gastrulation (24 h postfertilization) 
      in N. vectensis Surprisingly, beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling 
      regulate a subset of common downstream target genes in the GRN in opposite ways, 
      leading to the spatial and temporal differentiation of fields of cells in the 
      developing embryo. Thus, we show that regulatory interactions between 
      beta-catenin/Tcf signaling and BMP2/4 signaling are required for the specification 
      and determination of different embryonic regions and the patterning of the 
      oral-aboral axis in Nematostella We also show functionally that the conserved 
      "kernel" of the bilaterian heart mesoderm GRN is operational in N. vectensis, which 
      reinforces the hypothesis that the endoderm and mesoderm in triploblastic 
      bilaterians evolved from the bifunctional endomesoderm (gastrodermis) of a 
      diploblastic ancestor, and that slow rhythmic contractions might have been one of 
      the earliest functions of mesodermal tissue.

TI  - Multiplex Epigenome Editing of Dorsal Root Ganglion Neuron Receptors Abolishes 
      Redundant Interleukin 6, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha, and Interleukin 1β Signaling 
      by the Degenerative Intervertebral Disc.
PG  - 1147-1160
LID - 10.1089/hum.2019.032 [doi]
AB  - Back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide and contributes to 
      significant socioeconomic impacts. It has been hypothesized that the degenerative 
      intervertebral disc (IVD) contributes to back pain by sensitizing nociceptive 
      neurons innervating the IVD to stimuli that would not be painful to healthy 
      patients. However, the inflammatory signaling networks mediating this sensitization 
      remain poorly understood. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of 
      degenerative IVD-induced changes in nociception is required to improve the 
      understanding and treatment of back pain. Toward these ends, a novel in vitro model 
      was developed to investigate degenerative IVD-induced changes in dorsal root 
      ganglion (DRG) neuron activation by measuring DRG neuron activity following neuron 
      seeding on human degenerative IVD tissue collected from patients undergoing surgical 
      treatment for back pain. Lentiviral clustered regularly interspaced palindromic 
      repeat (CRISPR) epigenome editing vectors were built to downregulate the 
      inflammatory receptors TNFR1, IL1R1, and IL6st in DRG neurons in single- and 
      multiplex. Multiplex CRISPR epigenome editing of inflammatory receptors demonstrated 
      that degenerative IVD tissue drives thermal sensitization through the simultaneous 
      and redundant signaling of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), 
      and IL-1β. This work elucidates redundant signaling pathways in neuron interactions 
      with the degenerative IVD and suggests the need for multiplex targeting of IL-6, 
      TNF-α, and IL-1β for pain modulation in the degenerative IVD.

TI  - Remodeling of the Acetylproteome by SIRT3 Manipulation Fails to Affect Insulin 
      Secretion or β Cell Metabolism in the Absence of Overnutrition.
PG  - 209-223.e6
LID - S2211-1247(18)30869-6 [pii]

AB  - SIRT3 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent mitochondrial 
      protein deacetylase purported to influence metabolism through post-translational 
      modification of metabolic enzymes. Fuel-stimulated insulin secretion, which involves 
      mitochondrial metabolism, could be susceptible to SIRT3-mediated effects. We used 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology to manipulate SIRT3 expression in β cells, resulting in 
      widespread SIRT3-dependent changes in acetylation of key metabolic enzymes but no 
      appreciable changes in glucose- or pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion or 
      metabolomic profile during glucose stimulation. Moreover, these broad changes in the 
      SIRT3-targeted acetylproteome did not affect responses to nutritional or ER stress. 
      We also studied mice with global SIRT3 knockout fed either standard chow (STD) or 
      high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHS) diets. Only when chronically fed HFHS diet do SIRT3 
      KO animals exhibit a modest reduction in insulin secretion. We conclude that broad 
      changes in mitochondrial protein acetylation in response to manipulation of SIRT3 
      are not sufficient to cause changes in islet function or metabolism.

AB  - Genomic integration of expression cassettes containing heterologous genes into yeast 
      with traditional methods inevitably deposits undesirable genetic elements into yeast 
      chromosomes, such as plasmid-borne multiple cloning sites, antibiotic resistance 
      genes, Escherichia coli origins, and yeast auxotrophic markers. Specifically, drug 
      resistance genes for selecting transformants could hamper further industrial usage 
      of the resulting strains because of public health concerns. While we constructed an 
      efficient and rapid xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the engineered 
      strain (SR8) might not be readily used for a large-scale fermentation because the 
      SR8 strain contained multiple copies of drug resistance genes. We utilized the 
      Cas9/CRISPR-based technique to refactor an efficient xylose-fermenting yeast strain 
      without depositing any undesirable genetic elements in resulting strains. In order 
      to integrate genes (XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3) coding for xylose reductase, xylitol 
      dehydrogenase, and xylulokinase from Scheffersomyces stipitis, and delete both PHO13 
      and ALD6, a double-strand break formation by Cas9 and its repair by homologous 
      recombination were exploited. Specifically, plasmids containing guide RNAs targeting 
      PHO13 and ALD6 were sequentially co-transformed with linearized DNA fragments 
      containing XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3 into S. cerevisiae expressing Cas9. As a result, two 
      copies of XYL1, XYL2, and XYL3 were integrated into the loci of PHO13 and ALD6 for 
      achieving overexpression of heterologous genes and knockout of endogenous genes 
      simultaneously. With further prototrophic complementation, we were able to construct 
      an engineered strain exhibiting comparable xylose fermentation capabilities with SR8 
      within 3 weeks. We report a detailed procedure for refactoring xylose-fermenting 
      yeast using any host strains. The refactored strains using our procedure could be 
      readily used for large-scale fermentations since they have no antibiotic resistant 
      markers.

AB  - Cancer/testis antigen MAGEC2, a member of the type I melanoma-associated antigen 
      family, is expressed in a wide variety of cancer types but not in normal somatic 
      cells. MAGEC2 has long been recognized as a tumor-specific target, however, its 
      functions remain largely unknown. In this study, we established MAGEC2-knockout A375 
      melanoma cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Seven clonal cell lines were 
      generated by using four single guide RNAs targeting the coding region of the MAGEC2 
      gene, which produced indels that abolished MAGEC2 protein expression. To identify 
      the differentially expressed protein profiles associated with MAGEC2 loss, isobaric 
      tag for relative quantitation-based comparative proteomics experiments were carried 
      out on the MAGEC2-knockcout and control A375 cells. Mining of the proteomics data 
      identified a total 224 (61.6% upregulated and 38.4% downregulated) proteins to be 
      significantly altered in expression level in MAGEC2-knockcout cells. Ingenuity 
      Pathway Analysis indicated that the significantly altered proteins were involved in 
      critical neoplasia-related biological functions such as cell death, proliferation, 
      and movement. Gene ontology analysis identified "apoptosis signaling" as the 
      top-most upregulated pathway associated with MAGEC2 loss. We showed that knockout or 
      knockdown of the MAGEC2 gene sensitized melanoma cells to tumor necrosis 
      factor-α-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, actin-based motility by Rho and RhoA 
      signaling, known to promote cell migration, were also identified as the top 
      downregulated pathways in MAGEC2-knockout A375 cells. In short, our study provides a 
      suitable cell model for exploring the biological functions of MAGEC2 in malignant 
      cells, and sheds light on the molecular pathway by which MAGEC2 promotes tumor 
      development.

AB  - Genome-scale expression studies and comprehensive loss-of-function genetic screens 
      have focused almost exclusively on the highest confidence candidate genes. Here, we 
      describe a strategy for characterizing the lower confidence candidates identified by 
      such approaches. We interrogated 177 genes that we classified as essential for the 
      proliferation of cancer cells exhibiting constitutive β-catenin activity and 
      integrated data for each of the candidates, derived from orthogonal short hairpin 
      RNA (shRNA) knockdown and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated gene editing knockout screens, to yield 69 validated genes. 
      We then characterized the relationships between sets of these genes using 
      complementary assays: medium-throughput stable isotope labeling by amino acids in 
      cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry, yielding 3,639 protein-protein 
      interactions, and a CRISPR-mediated pairwise double knockout screen, yielding 375 
      combinations exhibiting greater- or lesser-than-additive phenotypic effects 
      indicating genetic interactions. These studies identify previously unreported 
      regulators of β-catenin, define functional networks required for the survival of 
      β-catenin-active cancers, and provide an experimental strategy that may be applied 
      to define other signaling networks.

TI  - Identification of Novel Adenylyl Cyclase 5 (AC5) Signaling Networks in D(1) and D(2) 
      Medium Spiny Neurons using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation Screening.
LID - 10.3390/cells8111468 [doi]
LID - 1468
AB  - Adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5), as the principal isoform expressed in striatal medium 
      spiny neurons (MSNs), is essential for the integration of both stimulatory and 
      inhibitory midbrain signals that initiate from dopaminergic G protein-coupled 
      receptor (GPCR) activation. The spatial and temporal control of cAMP signaling is 
      dependent upon the composition of local regulatory protein networks. However, there 
      is little understanding of how adenylyl cyclase protein interaction networks adapt 
      to the multifarious pressures of integrating acute versus chronic and inhibitory vs. 
      stimulatory receptor signaling in striatal MSNs. Here, we presented the development 
      of a novel bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC)-based protein-protein 
      interaction screening methodology to further identify and characterize elements 
      important for homeostatic control of dopamine-modulated AC5 signaling in a neuronal 
      model cell line and striatal MSNs. We identified two novel AC5 modulators: the 
      protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit (PPP2CB) and the intracellular 
      trafficking associated protein-NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment 
      protein alpha (NAPA). The effects of genetic knockdown (KD) of each gene were 
      evaluated in several cellular models, including D(1)- and D(2)-dopamine 
      receptor-expressing MSNs from CAMPER mice. The knockdown of PPP2CB was associated 
      with a reduction in acute and sensitized adenylyl cyclase activity, implicating PP2A 
      is an important and persistent regulator of adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast, 
      the effects of NAPA knockdown were more nuanced and appeared to involve an 
      activity-dependent protein interaction network. Taken together, these data represent 
      a novel screening method and workflow for the identification and validation of 
      adenylyl cyclase protein-protein interaction networks under diverse cAMP signaling 
      paradigms.

AB  - We report the generation-characterization of a fetal liver (FL) B-cell progenitor 
      (BCP)-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) line CRISPR/Cas9-edited to 
      carry/express a single copy of doxycycline-inducible Cas9 gene in the "safe locus" 
      AAVS1 (iCas9-FL-BCP-hiPSC). Gene-edited iPSCs remained pluripotent after CRISPR/Cas9 
      genome-edition. Correct genomic integration of a unique copy of Cas9 was confirmed 
      by PCR and Southern blot. Cas9 was robustly and specifically expressed on 
      doxycycline exposure. T7-endonuclease assay demonstrated that iCas9 induces robust 
      gene-edition when gRNAs against hematopoietic transcription factors were tested. 
      This iCas9-FL-BCP-hiPSC will facilitate gene-editing approaches for studies on 
      developmental biology, drug screening and disease modeling.

TI  - Genomic characterization of a local epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals specific 
      features of the widespread clone ST395.
PG  - e000129
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000129 [doi]
LID - e000129
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen with several clones 
      being frequently associated with outbreaks in hospital settings. ST395 is among 
      these so-called 'international' clones. We aimed here to define the biological 
      features that could have helped the implantation and spread of the clone ST395 in 
      hospital settings. The complete genome of a multidrug resistant index isolate 
      (DHS01) of a large hospital outbreak was analysed. We identified DHS01-specific 
      genetic elements, among which were identified those shared with a panel of six 
      independent ST395 isolates responsible for outbreaks in other hospitals. DHS01 has 
      the fifth largest chromosome of the species (7.1 Mbp), with most of its 1555 
      accessory genes borne by either genomic islands (GIs, n=48) or integrative and 
      conjugative elements (ICEs, n=5). DHS01 is multidrug resistant mostly due to 
      chromosomal mutations. It displayed signatures of adaptation to chronic infection in 
      part due to the loss of a 131 kbp chromosomal fragment. Four GIs were specific to 
      the clone ST395 and contained genes involved in metabolism (GI-4), in virulence 
      (GI-6) and in resistance to copper (GI-7). GI-7 harboured an array of six copper 
      transporters and was shared with non-pathogenic Pseudomonas sp. retrieved from 
      copper-contaminated environments. Copper resistance was confirmed phenotypically in 
      all other ST395 isolates and possibly accounted for the spreading capability of the 
      clone in hospital outbreaks, where water networks have been incriminated. This 
      suggests that genes transferred from copper-polluted environments may have favoured 
      the implantation and spread of the international clone P. aeruginosa ST395 in 
      hospital settings.

TI  - CBF-dependent and CBF-independent regulatory pathways contribute to the differences 
      in freezing tolerance and cold-regulated gene expression of two Arabidopsis ecotypes 
      locally adapted to sites in Sweden and Italy.
PG  - e0207723
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0207723 [doi]
LID - e0207723
AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) increases in freezing tolerance in response to 
      low nonfreezing temperatures, a phenomenon known as cold acclimation. The CBF 
      regulatory pathway, which contributes to cold acclimation, includes three 
      genes-CBF1, CBF2 and CBF3-encoding closely-related transcription factors that 
      regulate the expression of more than 100 genes-the CBF regulon-that impart freezing 
      tolerance. Here we compare the CBF pathways of two Arabidopsis ecotypes collected 
      from sites in Sweden (SW) and Italy (IT). Previous studies showed that the SW 
      ecotype was more freezing tolerant than the IT ecotype and that the IT ecotype had a 
      nonfunctional CBF2 gene. Here we present results establishing that the difference in 
      CBF2 alleles contributes to the difference in freezing tolerance between the two 
      ecotypes. However, other differences in the CBF pathway as well as CBF-independent 
      pathways contribute the large majority of the difference in freezing tolerance 
      between the two ecotypes. The results also provided evidence that most cold-induced 
      CBF regulon genes in both the SW and IT ecotypes are coregulated by CBF-independent 
      pathways. Additional analysis comparing our results with those published by others 
      examining the Col-0 accession resulted in the identification of 44 CBF regulon genes 
      that were conserved among the three accessions suggesting that they likely have 
      important functions in life at low temperature. The comparison further supported the 
      conclusion that the CBF pathway can account for a large portion of the increase in 
      freezing tolerance that occurs with cold acclimation in a given accession, but that 
      CBF-independent pathways can also make a major contribution.

TI  - SWITCH: a dynamic CRISPR tool for genome engineering and metabolic pathway control 
      for cell factory construction in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/s12934-017-0632-x [doi]
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is increasingly used as a cell 
      factory. However, cell factory construction time is a major obstacle towards using 
      yeast for bio-production. Hence, tools to speed up cell factory construction are 
      desirable. RESULTS: In this study, we have developed a new Cas9/dCas9 based system, 
      SWITCH, which allows Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains to iteratively alternate 
      between a genetic engineering state and a pathway control state. Since Cas9 induced 
      recombination events are crucial for SWITCH efficiency, we first developed a 
      technique TAPE, which we have successfully used to address protospacer efficiency. 
      As proof of concept of the use of SWITCH in cell factory construction, we have 
      exploited the genetic engineering state of a SWITCH strain to insert the five genes 
      necessary for naringenin production. Next, the naringenin cell factory was switched 
      to the pathway control state where production was optimized by downregulating an 
      essential gene TSC13, hence, reducing formation of a byproduct. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      successfully integrated two CRISPR tools, one for genetic engineering and one for 
      pathway control, into one system and successfully used it for cell factory 
      construction.

AB  - The limited supply of intracellular malonyl-CoA in Escherichia coli impedes the 
      biological synthesis of polyketides, flavonoids and biofuels. Here, a clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference system was 
      constructed for fine-tuning central metabolic pathways to efficiently channel carbon 
      flux toward malonyl-CoA. Using synthetic sgRNA to silence candidate genes, genes 
      that could increase the intracellular malonyl-CoA level by over 223% were used as 
      target genes. The efficiencies of repression of these genes were tuned to achieve 
      appropriate levels so that the intracellular malonyl-CoA level was enhanced without 
      significantly altering final biomass accumulation (the final OD600 decreased by less 
      than 10%). Based on the results, multiple gene repressing was successful in 
      approaching the limit of the amount of malonyl-CoA needed to produce the 
      plant-specific secondary metabolite (2S)-naringenin. By coupling the genetic 
      modifications to cell growth, the combined effects of these genetic perturbations 
      increased the final (2S)-naringenin titer to 421.6 mg/L, which was 7.4-fold higher 
      than the control strain. The strategy described here could be used to characterize 
      genes that are essential for cell growth and to develop E. coli as a well-organized 
      cell factory for producing other important products that require malonyl-CoA as a 
      precursor.

AB  - PAX5 encodes a transcription factor essential for B-cell differentiation, and PAX5 
      haploinsufficiency is involved in tumorigenesis. There were few studies on how PAX5 
      haploinsufficiency regulated genes expression to promote tumorigenesis. In this 
      study, we constructed the cell model of PAX5 haploinsufficiency using gene editing 
      technology in Raji cells, detected differentially expressed genes in PAX5 
      haploinsufficiency Raji cells, and used protein-protein interaction networks and 
      cluster analysis to comprehensively investigate the cellular pathways involved in 
      PAX5 haploinsufficiency. The clusters of gene transcription, inflammatory and immune 
      response, and cancer pathways were identified as three important pathways associated 
      with PAX5 haploinsufficiency in Raji cells. These changes hinted that the mechanism 
      of PAX5 haploinsufficiency promoting tumorigenesis may be related to genomic 
      instability, immune tolerance, and tumor pathways.

TI  - A truncating mutation in CEP55 is the likely cause of MARCH, a novel syndrome 
      affecting neuronal mitosis.
PG  - 490-501

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydranencephaly is a congenital anomaly leading to replacement of the 
      cerebral hemispheres with a fluid-filled cyst. The goals of this work are to 
      describe a novel autosomal-recessive syndrome that includes hydranencephaly 
      (multinucleated neurons, anhydramnios, renal dysplasia, cerebellar hypoplasia and 
      hydranencephaly (MARCH)); to identify its genetic cause(s) and to provide functional 
      insight into pathomechanism. METHODS: We used homozygosity mapping and exome 
      sequencing to identify recessive mutations in a single family with three affected 
      fetuses. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and imaging in cell lines, and zebrafish 
      models, were used to explore the function of the gene and the effect of the 
      mutation. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in CEP55 segregating 
      with MARCH. Testing the effect of this allele on patient-derived cells indicated 
      both a reduction of the overall CEP55 message and the production of a message that 
      likely gives rise to a truncated protein. Suppression or ablation of cep55l in 
      zebrafish embryos recapitulated key features of MARCH, most notably renal dysplasia, 
      cerebellar hypoplasia and craniofacial abnormalities. These phenotypes could be 
      rescued by full-length but not truncated human CEP55 message. Finally, we expressed 
      the truncated form of CEP55 in human cells, where we observed a failure of truncated 
      protein to localise to the midbody, leading to abscission failure and multinucleated 
      daughter cells. CONCLUSIONS: CEP55 loss of function mutations likely underlie MARCH, 
      a novel multiple congenital anomaly syndrome. This association expands the 
      involvement of centrosomal proteins in human genetic disorders by highlighting a 
      role in midbody function.

AB  - Divergence of upstream regulatory pathways of the transcription factor Doublesex 
      (Dsx) serves as a basis for evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in animals. 
      However, little is known about the regulation of Dsx in environmental sex 
      determination. In the crustacean Daphnia magna, environmental sex determination is 
      implemented by male-specific expression of the Dsx ortholog, Dsx1. Transcriptional 
      regulation of Dsx1 comprises at least three phases during embryogenesis: 
      non-sex-specific initiation, male-specific up-regulation, and its maintenance. 
      Herein, we demonstrate that the male-specific up-regulation is controlled by the 
      bZIP transcription factor, Vrille (Vri), an ortholog of the circadian clock 
      genes-Drosophila Vri and mammalian E4BP4/NFIL3. Sequence analysis of the Dsx1 
      promoter/enhancer revealed a conserved element among two Daphnia species (D. magna 
      and D. pulex), which contains a potential enhancer harboring a consensus Vri binding 
      site overlapped with a consensus Dsx binding site. Besides non-sex-specific 
      expression of Vri in late embryos, we found male-specific expression in early 
      gastrula before the Dsx1 up-regulation phase begins. Knockdown of Vri in male 
      embryos showed reduction of Dsx1 expression. In addition, transient overexpression 
      of Vri in early female embryos up-regulated the expression of Dsx1 and induced 
      male-specific trait. Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas9 disrupted the enhancer 
      on genome in males, which led to the reduction of Dsx1 expression. These results 
      indicate that Vri was co-opted as a transcriptional activator of Dsx1 in 
      environmental sex determination of D. magna. The data suggests the remarkably 
      plastic nature of gene regulatory network in sex determination.

AB  - Previously, we have identified the Grainyhead transcription factor 2 gene (GRHL2) as 
      notably hypomethylated in high-grade (HG) serous epithelial ovarian tumors, compared 
      with normal ovarian tissues. GRHL2 is known for its functions in normal tissue 
      development and wound healing. In the context of cancer, the role of GRHL2 is still 
      ambiguous as both tumorigenic and tumor suppressive functions have been reported for 
      this gene, although a role of GRHL2 in maintaining the epithelial status of cancer 
      cells has been suggested. In this study, we report that GRHL2 is strongly 
      overexpressed in both low malignant potential (LMP) and HG serous epithelial ovarian 
      tumors, which probably correlates with its hypomethylated status. Suppression of the 
      GRHL2 expression led to a sharp decrease in cell proliferation, migration and 
      invasion and induced G1 cell cycle arrest in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells 
      displaying either epithelial (A2780s) or mesenchymal (SKOV3) phenotypes. However, no 
      phenotypic alterations were observed in these EOC cell lines following GRHL2 
      silencing. Gene expression profiling and consecutive canonical pathway and network 
      analyses confirmed these data, as in both these EOC cell lines, GRHL2 ablation was 
      associated with the downregulation of various genes and pathways implicated in cell 
      growth and proliferation, cell cycle control and cellular metabolism. Taken 
      together, our data are indicative for a strong oncogenic potential of the GRHL2 gene 
      in EOC progression and support recent findings on the role of GRHL2 as one of the 
      major phenotypic stability factors (PSFs) that stabilize the highly 
      aggressive/metastatic hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype of cancer cells.

TI  - Zebrafish Oxr1a Knockout Reveals Its Role in Regulating Antioxidant Defenses and 
      Aging.
LID - 10.3390/genes11101118 [doi]
LID - 1118
AB  - Oxidation resistance gene 1 (OXR1) is essential for protection against oxidative 
      stress in mammals, but its functions in non-mammalian vertebrates, especially in 
      fish, remain uncertain. Here, we created a homozygous oxr1a-knockout zebrafish via 
      the CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR 
      associated protein 9) system. Compared with wild-type (WT) zebrafish, oxr1a(-/-) 
      mutants exhibited higher mortality and more apoptotic cells under oxidative stress, 
      and multiple antioxidant genes (i.e., gpx1b, gpx4a, gpx7 and sod3a) involved in 
      detoxifying cellular reactive oxygen species were downregulated significantly. Based 
      on these observations, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of early 
      oxidative stress response. The results show that oxr1a mutation caused more 
      extensive changes in transcriptional networks compared to WT zebrafish, and several 
      stress response and pro-inflammatory pathways in oxr1a(-/-) mutant zebrafish were 
      strongly induced. More importantly, we only observed the activation of the p53 
      signaling and apoptosis pathway in oxr1a(-/-) mutant zebrafish, revealing an 
      important role of oxr1a in regulating apoptosis via the p53 signaling pathway. 
      Additionally, we found that oxr1a mutation displayed a shortened lifespan and 
      premature ovarian failure in prolonged observation, which may be caused by the loss 
      of oxr1a impaired antioxidant defenses, thereby increasing pro-apoptotic events. 
      Altogether, our findings demonstrate that oxr1a is vital for antioxidant defenses 
      and anti-aging in zebrafish.

      thetaiotaomicron.
PG  - 962-969
LID - 10.1038/s41587-020-0468-5 [doi]
AB  - Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a human-associated bacterium that holds promise for 
      delivery of therapies in the gut microbiome(1). Therapeutic bacteria would benefit 
      from the ability to turn on different programs of gene expression in response to 
      conditions inside and outside of the gut; however, the availability of regulatory 
      parts, and methods to combine them, have been limited in B. thetaiotaomicron(2-5). 
      We report implementation of Cello circuit design automation software(6) for this 
      species. First, we characterize a set of genome-integrated NOT/NOR gates based on 
      single guide RNAs (CRISPR-dCas9) to inform a Bt user constraint file (UCF) for 
      Cello. Then, logic circuits are designed to integrate sensors that respond to bile 
      acid and anhydrotetracycline (aTc), including one created to distinguish between 
      environments associated with bioproduction, the human gut, and after release. This 
      circuit was found to be stable under laboratory conditions for at least 12 days and 
      to function in bacteria associated with a primary colonic epithelial monolayer in an 
      in vitro human gut model system.

TI  - Lessons from Animal Models of Cytoplasmic Intermediate Filament Proteins.
PG  - 171-230
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-49674-0_7 [doi]
AB  - Cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (IFs) represent a major cytoskeletal network 
      contributing to cell shape, adhesion and migration as well as to tissue resilience 
      and renewal in numerous bilaterians, including mammals. The observation that IFs are 
      dispensable in cultured mammalian cells, but cause tissue-specific, life-threatening 
      disorders, has pushed the need to investigate their function in vivo. In keeping 
      with human disease, the deletion or mutation of murine IF genes resulted in highly 
      specific pathologies. Epidermal keratins, together with desmin, are essential to 
      protect corresponding tissues against mechanical force but also participate in 
      stabilizing cell adhesion and in inflammatory signalling. Surprisingly, other IF 
      proteins contribute to tissue integrity to a much lesser extent than anticipated, 
      pointing towards their role in stress situations. In support, the overexpression of 
      small chaperones or the interference with inflammatory signalling in several 
      settings has been shown to rescue severe tissue pathologies that resulted from the 
      expression of mutant IF proteins. It stills remains an open issue whether the wide 
      range of IF disorders share similar pathomechanisms. Moreover, we lack an 
      understanding how IF proteins participate in signalling processes. Now, with a large 
      number of mouse models in hand, the next challenge will be to develop organotypic 
      cell culture models to dissect pathomechanisms at the molecular level, to employ 
      Crispr/Cas-mediated genome engineering to optimize models and, finally, to combine 
      available animal models with medicinal chemistry for the development of molecular 
      therapies.

TI  - Positive autofeedback regulation of Ptf1a transcription generates the levels of 
      PTF1A required to generate itch circuit neurons.
PG  - 621-636
LID - 10.1101/gad.332577.119 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral somatosensory input is modulated in the dorsal spinal cord by a network 
      of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. PTF1A is a transcription factor essential 
      in dorsal neural tube progenitors for specification of these inhibitory neurons. 
      Thus, mechanisms regulating Ptf1a expression are key for generating neuronal 
      circuits underlying somatosensory behaviors. Mutations targeted to distinct 
      cis-regulatory elements for Ptf1a in mice, tested the in vivo contribution of each 
      element individually and in combination. Mutations in an autoregulatory enhancer 
      resulted in reduced levels of PTF1A, and reduced numbers of specific dorsal spinal 
      cord inhibitory neurons, particularly those expressing Pdyn and Gal Although these 
      mutants survive postnatally, at ∼3-5 wk they elicit a severe scratching phenotype. 
      Behaviorally, the mutants have increased sensitivity to itch, but acute sensitivity 
      to other sensory stimuli such as mechanical or thermal pain is unaffected. We 
      demonstrate a requirement for positive transcriptional autoregulatory feedback to 
      attain the level of the neuronal specification factor PTF1A necessary for generating 
      correctly balanced neuronal circuits.

TI  - Loss of Ena/VASP interferes with lamellipodium architecture, motility and 
      integrin-dependent adhesion.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.55351 [doi]

AB  - Cell migration entails networks and bundles of actin filaments termed lamellipodia 
      and microspikes or filopodia, respectively, as well as focal adhesions, all of which 
      recruit Ena/VASP family members hitherto thought to antagonize efficient cell 
      motility. However, we find these proteins to act as positive regulators of migration 
      in different murine cell lines. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of Ena/VASP proteins 
      reduced lamellipodial actin assembly and perturbed lamellipodial architecture, as 
      evidenced by changed network geometry as well as reduction of filament length and 
      number that was accompanied by abnormal Arp2/3 complex and heterodimeric capping 
      protein accumulation. Loss of Ena/VASP function also abolished the formation of 
      microspikes normally embedded in lamellipodia, but not of filopodia capable of 
      emanating without lamellipodia. Ena/VASP-deficiency also impaired integrin-mediated 
      adhesion accompanied by reduced traction forces exerted through these structures. 
      Our data thus uncover novel Ena/VASP functions of these actin polymerases that are 
      fully consistent with their promotion of cell migration.

TI  - CRISPR interference-guided multiplex repression of endogenous competing pathway 
      genes for redirecting metabolic flux in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/s12934-017-0802-x [doi]
LID - 188
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiplex control of metabolic pathway genes is essential for maximizing 
      product titers and conversion yields of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals in 
      metabolic engineering. To achieve this goal, artificial transcriptional regulators, 
      such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) 
      interference (CRISPRi), have been developed to specifically repress genes of 
      interest. RESULTS: In this study, we deployed a tunable CRISPRi system for multiplex 
      repression of competing pathway genes and, thus, directed carbon flux toward 
      production of molecules of interest in Escherichia coli. The tunable CRISPRi system 
      with an array of sgRNAs successfully repressed four endogenous genes (pta, frdA, 
      ldhA, and adhE) individually and in double, triple, or quadruple combination that 
      are involved in the formation of byproducts (acetate, succinate, lactate, and 
      ethanol) and the consumption of NADH in E. coli. Single-target CRISPRi effectively 
      reduced the amount of each byproduct and, interestingly, pta repression also 
      decreased ethanol production (41%), whereas ldhA repression increased ethanol 
      production (197%). CRISPRi-mediated multiplex repression of competing pathway genes 
      also resulted in simultaneous reductions of acetate, succinate, lactate, and ethanol 
      production in E. coli. Among 15 conditions repressing byproduct-formation genes, we 
      chose the quadruple-target CRISPRi condition to produce n-butanol in E. coli as a 
      case study. When heterologous n-butanol-pathway enzymes were introduced into E. coli 
      simultaneously repressing the expression of the pta, frdA, ldhA, and adhE genes via 
      CRISPRi, n-butanol yield and productivity increased up to 5.4- and 3.2-fold, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the tunable CRISPRi system to be a robust 
      platform for multiplex modulation of endogenous gene expression that can be used to 
      enhance biosynthetic pathway productivity, with n-butanol as the test case. CRISPRi 
      applications potentially enable the development of microbial "smart cell" factories 
      capable of producing other industrially valuable products.

AB  - The response to DNA damage is critical for cellular homeostasis, tumor suppression, 
      immunity, and gametogenesis. In order to provide an unbiased and global view of the 
      DNA damage response in human cells, we undertook 31 CRISPR-Cas9 screens against 27 
      genotoxic agents in the retinal pigment epithelium-1 (RPE1) cell line. These screens 
      identified 890 genes whose loss causes either sensitivity or resistance to 
      DNA-damaging agents. Mining this dataset, we discovered that ERCC6L2 (which is 
      mutated in a bone-marrow failure syndrome) codes for a canonical non-homologous 
      end-joining pathway factor, that the RNA polymerase II component ELOF1 modulates the 
      response to transcription-blocking agents, and that the cytotoxicity of the 
      G-quadruplex ligand pyridostatin involves trapping topoisomerase II on DNA. This map 
      of the DNA damage response provides a rich resource to study this fundamental 
      cellular system and has implications for the development and use of genotoxic agents 
      in cancer therapy.

AB  - Disrupted energy metabolism drives cell dysfunction and disease, but approaches to 
      increase or preserve ATP are lacking. To generate a comprehensive metabolic map of 
      genes and pathways that regulate cellular ATP-the ATPome-we conducted a genome-wide 
      CRISPR interference/activation screen integrated with an ATP biosensor. We show that 
      ATP level is modulated by distinct mechanisms that promote energy production or 
      inhibit consumption. In our system HK2 is the greatest ATP consumer, indicating 
      energy failure may not be a general deficiency in producing ATP, but rather failure 
      to recoup the ATP cost of glycolysis and diversion of glucose metabolites to the 
      pentose phosphate pathway. We identify systems-level reciprocal inhibition between 
      the HIF1 pathway and mitochondria; glycolysis-promoting enzymes inhibit respiration 
      even when there is no glycolytic ATP production, and vice versa. Consequently, 
      suppressing alternative metabolism modes paradoxically increases energy levels under 
      substrate restriction. This work reveals mechanisms of metabolic control, and 
      identifies therapeutic targets to correct energy failure.

AB  - Viral infections of the cornea including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) cause visual 
      morbidity, and the corneal endothelial cell damage leads to significant visual 
      impairment. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) has been identified as a 
      significant regulator in corneal endothelial cells after an HSV-1 infection. To 
      examine the role played by IRF7, the DNA binding domain (DBD) of IRF7 of human 
      corneal endothelial cells (HCEn) was disrupted. An RNAi inhibition of IRF7 and IRF7 
      DBD disruption (IRF7 ∆DBD) led to an impairment of IFN-β production. Impaired IFN-β 
      production by IRF7 ∆DBD was regained by IRF7 DNA transfection. Transcriptional 
      network analysis indicated that IRF7 plays a role in antigen presentation function 
      of corneal endothelial cells. When the antigen presentation activity of HCEn cells 
      were examined for priming of memory CD8 T cells, IRF7 disruption abolished the 
      anti-viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response which was dependent on the major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. To further examine the roles played by 
      IRF7 in CTL induction as acquired immunity, the contribution of IRF7 to MHC class 
      I-mediated antigen presentation was assessed. Analysis of IRF7 ∆DBD cells indicated 
      that IRF7 played an unrecognized role in MHC class I induction, and the viral 
      infection induced-MHC class I induction was abolished by IRF7 disruption. 
      Collectively, the IRF7 in corneal endothelial cells not only contributed to type I 
      IFN response, but also to the mediation of viral infection-induced MHC class I 
      upregulation and priming of CD8 arm of acquired immunity.

TI  - Genome-wide CRISPR screen for PARKIN regulators reveals transcriptional repression 
      as a determinant of mitophagy.
PG  - E180-E189
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1711023115 [doi]
AB  - PARKIN, an E3 ligase mutated in familial Parkinson's disease, promotes mitophagy by 
      ubiquitinating mitochondrial proteins for efficient engagement of the autophagy 
      machinery. Specifically, PARKIN-synthesized ubiquitin chains represent targets for 
      the PINK1 kinase generating phosphoS65-ubiquitin (pUb), which constitutes the 
      mitophagy signal. Physiological regulation of PARKIN abundance, however, and the 
      impact on pUb accumulation are poorly understood. Using cells designed to discover 
      physiological regulators of PARKIN abundance, we performed a pooled genome-wide 
      CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen. Testing identified genes individually resulted in a 
      list of 53 positive and negative regulators. A transcriptional repressor network 
      including THAP11 was identified and negatively regulates endogenous PARKIN 
      abundance. RNAseq analysis revealed the PARKIN-encoding locus as a prime THAP11 
      target, and THAP11 CRISPR knockout in multiple cell types enhanced pUb accumulation. 
      Thus, our work demonstrates the critical role of PARKIN abundance, identifies 
      regulating genes, and reveals a link between transcriptional repression and 
      mitophagy, which is also apparent in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
      neurons, a disease-relevant cell type.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.63997 [doi]
LID - e63997
AB  - UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) 1 and 2 are central hubs in the 
      chaperone network of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acting as gatekeepers to the 
      early secretory pathway, yet little is known about their cellular clients. These two 
      quality control sensors control lectin chaperone binding and glycoprotein egress 
      from the ER. A quantitative glycoproteomics strategy was deployed to identify 
      cellular substrates of the UGGTs at endogenous levels in CRISPR-edited HEK293 cells. 
      The 71 UGGT substrates identified were mainly large multidomain and heavily 
      glycosylated proteins when compared to the general N-glycoproteome. UGGT1 was the 
      dominant glucosyltransferase with a preference toward large plasma membrane proteins 
      whereas UGGT2 favored the modification of smaller, soluble lysosomal proteins. This 
      study sheds light on differential specificities and roles of UGGT1 and UGGT2 and 
      provides insight into the cellular reliance on the carbohydrate-dependent chaperone 
      system to facilitate proper folding and maturation of the cellular N-glycoproteome.

AB  - Proteins often assemble into multiprotein complexes for carrying out their 
      biological functions. Affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) 
      is a method of choice for unbiasedly charting protein complexes. Typically, 
      genetically tagged bait protein and associated proteins are immunoprecipitated from 
      cell lysate and subjected to in-gel or on-bead digestion for MS analysis. However, 
      the sample preparation procedures are often time-consuming and skipping reduction 
      and alkylation steps results in incomplete digestion. Here, by seamlessly combining 
      AP with the simple and integrated spintip-based proteomics technology (SISPROT), we 
      developed an integrated AP-MS workflow for simultaneously processing more than 10 AP 
      samples from cells cultured in six-well plates in 2 h. Moreover, we developed a 
      quantitation-based data analysis workflow for differentiating potential interacting 
      proteins from nonspecific interferences. The AP-SISPROT ensures high digestion 
      efficiency especially for large transmembrane proteins such as EGFR and high 
      quantification precision for profiling temporal interaction network of key EGFR 
      signaling protein GRB2 across four time points of EGF treatment. More importantly, 
      the integration feature allows minimum sample lose and helps the development of an 
      ideal AP-MS workflow for studying endogenous protein complexes by the CRISPR Cas9 
      technology for the first time. By generating endogenously expressed bait protein 
      fused with affinity tag, protein complexes associated with endogenous 
      Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) was identified with much higher selectivity as compared 
      with overexpressed and tagged ILK. The AP-SISPROT technology and its combination 
      with CRISPR Cas9 technology should be generally applicable for studying protein 
      complexes in a more efficient and physiologically relevant manner.

TI  - A Minor Subset of Super Elongation Complexes Plays a Predominant Role in Reversing 
      HIV-1 Latency.
PG  - 1194-205
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00994-15 [doi]
AB  - Promoter-proximal pausing by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a key rate-limiting step 
      in HIV-1 transcription and latency reversal. The viral Tat protein recruits human 
      super elongation complexes (SECs) to paused Pol II to overcome this restriction. 
      Despite the recent progress in understanding the functions of different subsets of 
      SECs in controlling cellular and Tat-activated HIV transcription, little is known 
      about the SEC subtypes that help reverse viral latency in CD4(+) T cells. Here, we 
      used the CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing tool to knock out the gene encoding the SEC 
      subunit ELL2, AFF1, or AFF4 in Jurkat/2D10 cells, a well-characterized HIV-1 latency 
      model. Depletion of these proteins drastically reduced spontaneous and drug-induced 
      latency reversal by suppressing HIV-1 transcriptional elongation. Surprisingly, a 
      low-abundance subset of SECs containing ELL2 and AFF1 was found to play a 
      predominant role in cooperating with Tat to reverse latency. By increasing the 
      cellular level/activity of these Tat-friendly SECs, we could potently activate 
      latent HIV-1 without using any drugs. These results implicate the ELL2/AFF1-SECs as 
      an important target in the future design of a combinatorial therapeutic approach to 
      purge latent HIV-1.

AB  - According to the latest report from the World Health Organization, an estimated 
      265,000 deaths still occur every year as a direct result of burn injuries. A 
      widespread range of these deaths induced by burn wound happens in low- and 
      middle-income countries, where survivors face a lifetime of morbidity. Most of the 
      deaths occur due to infections when a high percentage of the external regions of the 
      body area is affected. Microbial nutrient availability, skin barrier disruption, and 
      vascular supply destruction in burn injuries as well as systemic immunosuppression 
      are important parameters that cause burns to be susceptible to infections. Topical 
      antimicrobials and dressings are generally employed to inhibit burn infections 
      followed by a burn wound therapy, because systemic antibiotics have problems in 
      reaching the infected site, coupled with increasing microbial drug resistance. 
      Nanotechnology has provided a range of molecular designed nanostructures (NS) that 
      can be used in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications in burns. These NSs can 
      be divided into organic and non-organic (such as polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) and 
      silver NPs, respectively), and many have been designed to display multifunctional 
      activity. The present review covers the physiology of skin, burn classification, 
      burn wound pathogenesis, animal models of burn wound infection, and various topical 
      therapeutic approaches designed to combat infection and stimulate healing. These 
      include biological based approaches (e.g. immune-based antimicrobial molecules, 
      therapeutic microorganisms, antimicrobial agents, etc.), antimicrobial photo- and 
      ultrasound-therapy, as well as nanotechnology-based wound healing approaches as a 
      revolutionizing area. Thus, we focus on organic and non-organic NSs designed to 
      deliver growth factors to burned skin, and scaffolds, dressings, etc. for exogenous 
      stem cells to aid skin regeneration. Eventually, recent breakthroughs and 
      technologies with substantial potentials in tissue regeneration and skin wound 
      therapy (that are as the basis of burn wound therapies) are briefly taken into 
      consideration including 3D-printing, cell-imprinted substrates, nano-architectured 
      surfaces, and novel gene-editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas.

AB  - Electronic information can be transmitted to cells directly from microelectronics 
      via electrode-activated redox mediators. These transmissions are decoded by 
      redox-responsive promoters which enable user-specified control over biological 
      function. Here, we build on this redox communication modality by establishing an 
      electronic eCRISPR conduit of information exchange. This system acts as a biological 
      signal processor, amplifying signal reception and filtering biological noise. We 
      electronically amplify bacterial quorum sensing (QS) signaling by activating LasI, 
      the autoinducer-1 synthase. Similarly, we filter out unintended noise by inhibiting 
      the native SoxRS-mediated oxidative stress response regulon. We then construct an 
      eCRISPR based redox conduit in both E. coli and Salmonella enterica. Finally, we 
      display eCRISPR based information processing that allows transmission of 
      spatiotemporal redox commands which are then decoded by gelatin-encapsulated E. 
      coli. We anticipate that redox communication channels will enable biohybrid 
      microelectronic devices that could transform our abilities to electronically 
      interpret and control biological function.

AB  - Miltiradiene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of many important natural 
      diterpene compounds with significant pharmacological activity, including triptolide, 
      tanshinones, carnosic acid and carnosol. Sufficient accumulation of miltiradiene is 
      vital for the production of these medicinal compounds. In this study, comprehensive 
      engineering strategies were applied to construct a high-yielding miltiradiene 
      producing yeast strain. First, a chassis strain that can accumulate 2.1 g L(-1) 
      geranylgeraniol was constructed. Then, diterpene synthases from various species were 
      evaluated for their ability to produce miltiradiene, and a chimeric miltiradiene 
      synthase, consisting of class II diterpene synthase (di-TPS) CfTPS1 from Coleus 
      forskohlii (Plectranthus barbatus) and class I di-TPS SmKSL1 from Salvia 
      miltiorrhiza showed the highest efficiency in the conversion of GGPP to miltiradiene 
      in yeast. Moreover, the miltiradiene yield was further improved by protein 
      modification, which resulted in a final yield of 550.7 mg L(-1) in shake flasks and 
      3.5 g L(-1) in a 5-L bioreactor. This work offers an efficient and green process for 
      the production of the important intermediate miltiradiene, and lays a foundation for 
      further pathway reconstruction and the biotechnological production of valuable 
      natural diterpenes.

AB  - Clinical trials of high-dose androgen (HDA) therapy for prostate cancer (PC) have 
      shown promising efficacy but are limited by lack of criteria to identify likely 
      responders. To elucidate factors that govern the growth-repressive effects of HDAs, 
      we applied an unbiased integrative approach using genetic screens and 
      transcriptional profiling of PC cells with or without demonstrated phenotypic 
      sensitivity to androgen-mediated growth repression. Through this comprehensive 
      analysis, we identified genetic events and related signaling networks that determine 
      the response to both HDA and androgen withdrawal. We applied these findings to 
      develop a gene signature that may serve as an early indicator of treatment response 
      and identify men with tumors that are amenable to HDA therapy.

PG  - 3183
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.03183 [doi]
LID - 3183
AB  - The response to iron limitation of several bacteria is regulated by the ferric 
      uptake regulator (Fur). The Fur-regulated transcriptional, translational and 
      metabolic networks of the Gram-positive, pathogen Clostridioides difficile were 
      investigated by a combined RNA sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic and electron 
      microscopy approach. At high iron conditions (15 μM) the C. difficile fur mutant 
      displayed a growth deficiency compared to wild type C. difficile cells. Several iron 
      and siderophore transporter genes were induced by Fur during low iron (0.2 μM) 
      conditions. The major adaptation to low iron conditions was observed for the central 
      energy metabolism. Most ferredoxin-dependent amino acid fermentations were 
      significantly down regulated (had, etf, acd, grd, trx, bdc, hbd). The substrates of 
      these pathways phenylalanine, leucine, glycine and some intermediates 
      (phenylpyruvate, 2-oxo-isocaproate, 3-hydroxy-butyryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA) 
      accumulated, while end products like isocaproate and butyrate were found reduced. 
      Flavodoxin (fldX) formation and riboflavin biosynthesis (rib) were enhanced, most 
      likely to replace the missing ferredoxins. Proline reductase (prd), the 
      corresponding ion pumping RNF complex (rnf) and the reaction product 5-aminovalerate 
      were significantly enhanced. An ATP forming ATPase (atpCDGAHFEB) of the 
      F(0)F(1)-type was induced while the formation of a ATP-consuming, proton-pumping 
      V-type ATPase (atpDBAFCEKI) was decreased. The [Fe-S] enzyme-dependent pyruvate 
      formate lyase (pfl), formate dehydrogenase (fdh) and hydrogenase (hyd) branch of 
      glucose utilization and glycogen biosynthesis (glg) were significantly reduced, 
      leading to an accumulation of glucose and pyruvate. The formation of [Fe-S] enzyme 
      carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coo) was inhibited. The fur mutant showed an 
      increased sensitivity to vancomycin and polymyxin B. An intensive remodeling of the 
      cell wall was observed, Polyamine biosynthesis (spe) was induced leading to an 
      accumulation of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. The fur mutant lost most of 
      its flagella and motility. Finally, the CRISPR/Cas and a prophage encoding operon 
      were downregulated. Fur binding sites were found upstream of around 20 of the 
      regulated genes. Overall, adaptation to low iron conditions in C. difficile focused 
      on an increase of iron import, a significant replacement of iron requiring metabolic 
      pathways and the restructuring of the cell surface for protection during the complex 
      adaptation phase and was only partly directly regulated by Fur.

AB  - During development, cell fate decisions are often highly stochastic, but with the 
      frequency of the different possible fates tightly controlled. To understand how 
      signaling networks control the cell fate frequency of such random decisions, we 
      studied the stochastic decision of the Caenorhabditis elegans P3.p cell to either 
      fuse to the hypodermis or assume vulva precursor cell fate. Using time-lapse 
      microscopy to measure the single-cell dynamics of two key inhibitors of cell fusion, 
      the Hox gene LIN-39 and Wnt signaling through the β-catenin BAR-1, we uncovered 
      significant variability in the dynamics of LIN-39 and BAR-1 levels. Most strikingly, 
      we observed that BAR-1 accumulated in a single, 1-4 ​h pulse at the time of the P3.p 
      cell fate decision, with strong variability both in pulse slope and time of pulse 
      onset. We found that the time of BAR-1 pulse onset was delayed relative to the time 
      of cell fusion in mutants with low cell fusion frequency, linking BAR-1 pulse timing 
      to cell fate outcome. Overall, a model emerged where animal-to-animal variability in 
      LIN-39 levels and BAR-1 pulse dynamics biases cell fate by modulating their absolute 
      level at the time cell fusion is induced. Our results highlight that timing of cell 
      signaling dynamics, rather than its average level or amplitude, could play an 
      instructive role in determining cell fate.

AB  - Isogenic pairs of cell lines, which differ by a single genetic modification, are 
      powerful tools for understanding gene function. Generating such pairs of mammalian 
      cells, however, is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and, in some cell types, 
      essentially impossible. Here, we present an approach to create isogenic pairs of 
      cells that avoids single cell cloning, and screen these pairs with genome-wide 
      CRISPR-Cas9 libraries to generate genetic interaction maps. We query the 
      anti-apoptotic genes BCL2L1 and MCL1, and the DNA damage repair gene PARP1, 
      identifying both expected and uncharacterized buffering and synthetic lethal 
      interactions. Additionally, we compare acute CRISPR-based knockout, single cell 
      clones, and small-molecule inhibition. We observe that, while the approaches provide 
      largely overlapping information, differences emerge, highlighting an important 
      consideration when employing genetic screens to identify and characterize potential 
      drug targets. We anticipate that this methodology will be broadly useful to 
      comprehensively study gene function across many contexts.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles mediate transfer of biologically active molecules between 
      neighboring or distant cells, and these vesicles may play important roles in normal 
      physiology and the pathogenesis of multiple disease states including cancer. 
      However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their biogenesis and release remain 
      unknown. We designed artificially barcoded, exosomal microRNAs (bEXOmiRs) to monitor 
      extracellular vesicle release quantitatively using deep sequencing. We then 
      expressed distinct pairs of CRISPR guide RNAs and bEXOmiRs, enabling identification 
      of genes influencing bEXOmiR secretion from Cas9-edited cells. This approach 
      uncovered genes with unrecognized roles in multivesicular endosome exocytosis, 
      including critical roles for Wnt signaling in extracellular vesicle release 
      regulation. Coupling bEXOmiR reporter analysis with CRISPR-Cas9 screening provides a 
      powerful and unbiased means to study extracellular vesicle biology and for the first 
      time, to associate a nucleic acid tag with individual membrane vesicles.

TI  - Brain tumor modeling using the CRISPR/Cas9 system: state of the art and view to the 
      future.

AB  - Although brain tumors have been known tremendously over the past decade, there are 
      still many problems to be solved. The etiology of brain tumors is not well 
      understood and the treatment remains modest. There is in great need to develop a 
      suitable brain tumor models that faithfully mirror the etiology of human brain 
      neoplasm and subsequently get more efficient therapeutic approaches for these 
      disorders. In this review, we described the current status of animal models of brain 
      tumors and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, prokaryotic 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 
      protein 9 (Cas9), a versatile genome editing technology for investigating the 
      functions of target genes, and its application were also introduced in our present 
      work. We firstly proposed that brain tumor modeling could be well established via 
      CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. And CRISPR/Cas9-mediated brain tumor modeling was likely to 
      be more suitable for figuring out the pathogenesis of brain tumors, as CRISPR/Cas9 
      platform was a simple and more efficient biological toolbox for implementing 
      mutagenesis of oncogenes or tumor suppressors that were closely linked with brain 
      tumors.

TI  - ERCC6L2 promotes DNA orientation-specific recombination in mammalian cells.
PG  - 732-744
LID - 10.1038/s41422-020-0328-3 [doi]
AB  - Programmed DNA recombination in mammalian cells occurs predominantly in a 
      directional manner. While random DNA breaks are typically repaired both by deletion 
      and by inversion at approximately equal proportions, V(D)J and class switch 
      recombination (CSR) of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene overwhelmingly delete 
      intervening sequences to yield productive rearrangement. What factors channel 
      chromatin breaks to deletional CSR in lymphocytes is unknown. Integrating CRISPR 
      knockout and chemical perturbation screening we here identify the Snf2-family 
      helicase-like ERCC6L2 as one such factor. We show that ERCC6L2 promotes 
      double-strand break end-joining and facilitates optimal CSR in mice. At the cellular 
      levels, ERCC6L2 rapidly engages in DNA repair through its C-terminal domains. 
      Mechanistically, ERCC6L2 interacts with other end-joining factors and plays a 
      functionally redundant role with the XLF end-joining factor in V(D)J recombination. 
      Strikingly, ERCC6L2 controls orientation-specific joining of broken ends during CSR, 
      which relies on its helicase activity. Thus, ERCC6L2 facilitates programmed 
      recombination through directional repair of distant breaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a great interest in the efficient intracellular delivery of 
      Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) and its possible applications for in vivo 
      CRISPR-based gene editing. In this study, a nanoporous mediated gene-editing 
      approach has been successfully performed using a bi-functionalized 
      aminoguanidine-PEGylated periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) nanoparticles 
      (RNP@AGu@PEG(1500)-PMO) as a potent and biocompatible nanocarrier for RNP delivery. 
      RESULTS: The bi-functionalized MSN-based nanomaterials have been fully characterized 
      using electron microscopy (TEM and SEM), nitrogen adsorption measurements, 
      thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Attenuated Total 
      Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and dynamic light 
      scattering (DLS). The results confirm that AGu@PEG(1500)-PMO can be applied for 
      gene-editing with an efficiency of about 40% as measured by GFP gene knockdown of 
      HT1080-GFP cells with no notable change in the morphology of the cells. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Due to the high stability and biocompatibility, simple synthesis, and 
      cost-effectiveness, the developed bi-functionalized PMO-based nano-network 
      introduces a tailored nanocarrier that has remarkable potential as a promising 
      trajectory for biomedical and RNP delivery applications.

LID - 10.1126/science.aar8384 [doi]
AB  - Hox genes encode conserved developmental transcription factors that govern 
      anterior-posterior (A-P) pattering in diverse bilaterian animals, which display 
      bilateral symmetry. Although Hox genes are also present within Cnidaria, these 
      simple animals lack a definitive A-P axis, leaving it unclear how and when a 
      functionally integrated Hox code arose during evolution. We used short hairpin RNA 
      (shRNA)-mediated knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to demonstrate that a Hox-Gbx 
      network controls radial segmentation of the larval endoderm during development of 
      the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Loss of Hox-Gbx activity also elicits marked 
      defects in tentacle patterning along the directive (orthogonal) axis of primary 
      polyps. On the basis of our results, we propose that an axial Hox code may have 
      controlled body patterning and tissue segmentation before the evolution of the 
      bilaterian A-P axis.

PG  - e0198541

LID - e0198541
AB  - This paper applies objective methods to explore the technological origins of the 
      widely acclaimed CRISPR breakthrough in the technological domain of genome 
      engineering. Previously developed patent search techniques are first used to recover 
      a set of patents that well-represent the genome editing domain before CRISPR. Main 
      paths are then determined from the citation network associated with this patent set 
      allowing identification of the three major knowledge trajectories. The most 
      significant of these trajectories for CRISPR involves the core of genome editing 
      with less significant trajectories involving cloning and endonuclease specific 
      developments. The major patents on the core trajectory are consistent with 
      qualitative expert knowledge of the topical area. A second set of patents that we 
      call the CRISPR roots are obtained by finding the patents directly cited by the 
      recent CRISPR patents along with patents cited by that set of patents. We find that 
      the CRISPR roots contain 8 key patents from the genome engineering main path 
      associated with restriction endonucleases and the expected strong connection of 
      CRISPR to prior genome editing technology such as Zn finger nucleases. Nonetheless, 
      analysis of the full CRISPR roots shows that a very wide array of technological 
      knowledge beyond genome engineering has contributed to achieving the CRISPR 
      breakthrough. Such breadth in origins is not surprising since "spillover" is 
      generally perceived as important and previous qualitative studies of CRISPR have 
      shown not only technological breadth in origins but scientific breadth as well. In 
      addition, we find that the estimated rate of functional performance improvement of 
      the CRISPR roots set is about 9% per year compared to the genome engineering set 
      (~4% per year). These estimates indicate below average rates of improvement and may 
      indicate that CRISPR (and perhaps yet undiscovered) genome engineering developments 
      could evolve in effectiveness over an upcoming long rather than short time period.

LID - 10.2337/db19-0873 [doi]
AB  - Progression from the initial vascular response upon hyperglycemia to a proliferative 
      stage with neovacularizations is the hallmark of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
      Here, we report on the novel diabetic pdx1 (-/-) zebrafish mutant as a model for 
      diabetic retinopathy that lacks the transcription factor pdx1 through 
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout leading to disturbed pancreatic development and 
      hyperglycemia. Larval pdx1 (-/-) mutants prominently show vasodilation of blood 
      vessels through increased vascular thickness in the hyaloid network as direct 
      developmental precursor of the adult retinal vasculature in zebrafish. In adult pdx1 
      (-/-) mutants, impaired glucose homeostasis induces increased hyperbranching and 
      hypersprouting with new vessel formation in the retina and aggravation of the 
      vascular alterations from the larval to the adult stage. Both vascular aspects 
      respond to antiangiogenic and antihyperglycemic pharmacological interventions in the 
      larval stage and are accompanied by alterations in the nitric oxide metabolism. 
      Thus, the pdx1 (-/-) mutant represents a novel model to study mechanisms of 
      hyperglycemia-induced retinopathy wherein extensive proangiogenic alterations in 
      blood vessel morphology and metabolic alterations underlie the vascular phenotype.

TI  - Motor protein binding and mitochondrial transport are altered by pathogenic TUBB4A 
      variants.
PG  - 1901-1915
LID - 10.1002/humu.23602 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in TUBB4A have been identified to cause a wide phenotypic spectrum of 
      diseases ranging from hereditary generalized dystonia with whispering dysphonia 
      (DYT-TUBB4A) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) to leukodystrophy 
      hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC). TUBB4A 
      encodes the brain-specific β-tubulin isotype, β-tubulin 4A. To elucidate the 
      pathogenic mechanisms conferred by TUBB4A mutations leading to the different 
      phenotypes, we functionally characterized three pathogenic TUBB4A variants 
      (c.4C>G,p.R2G; c.745G>A,p.D249N; c.811G>A, p.A271T) as representatives of the 
      mutational and disease spectrum) in human neuroblastoma cells and human induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We showed that mRNA stability was not 
      affected by any of the TUBB4A variants. Although two mutations (p.R2G and p.D249N) 
      are located at the α/β-tubulin interdimer interface, we confirmed incorporation of 
      all TUBB4A mutants into the microtubule network. However, we showed that the 
      mutations p.D249N and p.A271T interfered with motor protein binding to microtubules 
      and impaired neurite outgrowth and microtubule dynamics. Finally, TUBB4A mutations, 
      as well as heterozygous knockout of TUBB4A, disrupted mitochondrial transport in 
      iPSC-derived neurons. Taken together, our findings suggest that functional 
      impairment of microtubule-associated transport is a shared pathogenic mechanism by 
      which the TUBB4A mutations studied here cause a spectrum of diseases.

TI  - Establishment of CRISPR interference in Methylorubrum extorquens and application of 
      rapidly mining a new phytoene desaturase involved in carotenoid biosynthesis.
PG  - 4515-4532
LID - 10.1007/s00253-020-10543-w [doi]
AB  - The methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 holds a great potential of 
      a microbial cell factory in producing high value chemicals with methanol as the sole 
      carbon and energy source. However, many gene functions remain unknown, hampering 
      further rewiring of metabolic networks. Clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat interference (CRISPRi) has been demonstrated to be a robust tool 
      for gene knockdown in diverse organisms. In this study, we developed an efficient 
      CRISPRi system through optimizing the promoter strength of Streptococcus 
      pyogenes-derived deactivated cas9 (dcas9). When the dcas9 and sgRNA were 
      respectively controlled by medium P(R/tetO) and strong P(mxaF-g) promoters, dynamic 
      repression efficacy of cell growth through disturbing a central metabolism gene glyA 
      was achieved from 41.9 to 96.6% dependent on the sgRNA targeting sites. Furthermore, 
      the optimized CRISPRi system was shown to effectively decrease the abundance of 
      exogenous fluorescent protein gene mCherry over 50% and to reduce the expression of 
      phytoene desaturase gene crtI by 97.7%. We then used CRISPRi technology combined 
      with 26 sgRNAs pool to rapidly discover a new phytoene desaturase gene META1_3670 
      from 2470 recombinant mutants. The gene function was further verified through gene 
      deletion and complementation as well as phylogenetic tree analysis. In addition, we 
      applied CRISPRi to repress the transcriptional level of squalene-hopene cyclase gene 
      shc involved in hopanoid biosynthesis by 64.9%, which resulted in enhancing 1.9-fold 
      higher of carotenoid production without defective cell growth. Thus, the CRISPRi 
      system developed here provides a useful tool in mining functional gene of M. 
      extorquens as well as in biotechnology for producing high-valued chemicals from 
      methanol. KEY POINTS: Developing an efficient CRISPRi to knockdown gene expression 
      in C1-utilizing bacteria CRISPRi combined with sgRNAs pool to rapidly discover a new 
      phytoene desaturase gene Improvement of carotenoid production by repressing a 
      competitive pathway.

AB  - We present FLEX (Functional evaluation of experimental perturbations), a pipeline 
      that leverages several functional annotation resources to establish reference 
      standards for benchmarking human genome-wide CRISPR screen data and methods for 
      analyzing them. FLEX provides a quantitative measurement of the functional 
      information captured by a given gene-pair dataset and a means to explore the 
      diversity of functions captured by the input dataset. We apply FLEX to analyze data 
      from the diverse cell line screens generated by the DepMap project. We identify a 
      predominant mitochondria-associated signal within co-essentiality networks derived 
      from these data and explore the basis of this signal. Our analysis and time-resolved 
      CRISPR screens in a single cell line suggest that the variable phenotypes associated 
      with mitochondria genes across cells may reflect screen dynamics and protein 
      stability effects rather than genetic dependencies. We characterize this functional 
      bias and demonstrate its relevance for interpreting differential hits in any CRISPR 
      screening context. More generally, we demonstrate the utility of the FLEX pipeline 
      for performing robust comparative evaluations of CRISPR screens or methods for 
      processing them.

TI  - Screening for CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutations using a co-injection marker in the 
      nematode Pristionchus pacificus.
PG  - 257-264
LID - 10.1007/s00427-020-00651-y [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing methods are used to reveal functions of genes and 
      molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes in many species, including 
      nematodes. In evolutionary biology, the nematode Pristionchus pacificus is a 
      satellite model and has been used to understand interesting phenomena such as 
      phenotypic plasticity and self-recognition. In P. pacificus, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
      mutations are induced by microinjecting a guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 protein into the 
      gonads. However, mutant screening is laborious and time-consuming due to the absence 
      of visual markers. In this study, we established a Co-CRISPR strategy by using a 
      dominant roller marker in P. pacificus. We found that heterozygous mutations in 
      Ppa-prl-1 induced the roller phenotype, which can be used as an injection marker. 
      After the co-injection of Ppa-prl-1 gRNA, target gRNA, and the Cas9 protein, roller 
      progeny and their siblings were examined using the heteroduplex mobility assay and 
      DNA sequencing. We found that some of the roller and non-roller siblings had 
      mutations at the target site. We used varying Cas9 concentrations and found that a 
      higher concentration of Cas9 did not increase genome-editing events. The Co-CRISPR 
      strategy promotes the screening for genome-editing events and will facilitate the 
      development of new genome-editing methods in P. pacificus.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated heterozygous knockout of the autism gene CHD8 and 
      characterization of its transcriptional networks in cerebral organoids derived from 
      iPS cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 8), which codes for a 
      member of the CHD family of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors, is one of 
      the most commonly mutated genes in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) identified in 
      exome-sequencing studies. Loss of function mutations in the gene have also been 
      found in schizophrenia (SZ) and intellectual disabilities and influence cancer cell 
      proliferation. We previously reported an RNA-seq analysis carried out on neural 
      progenitor cells (NPCs) and monolayer neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem 
      (iPS) cells that were heterozygous for CHD8 knockout (KO) alleles generated using 
      CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. A significant number of ASD and SZ candidate genes were 
      among those that were differentially expressed in a comparison of heterozygous KO 
      lines (CHD8(+/-)) vs isogenic controls (CHD8(+/-)), including the SZ and bipolar 
      disorder (BD) candidate gene TCF4, which was markedly upregulated in CHD8(+/-) 
      neuronal cells. METHODS: In the current study, RNA-seq was carried out on CHD8(+/-) 
      and isogenic control (CHD8(+/+)) cerebral organoids, which are 3-dimensional 
      structures derived from iPS cells that model the developing human telencephalon. 
      RESULTS: TCF4 expression was, again, significantly upregulated. Pathway analysis 
      carried out on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed an enrichment of genes 
      involved in neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, forebrain development, 
      Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and axonal guidance, similar to our previous study on NPCs 
      and monolayer neurons. There was also significant overlap in our CHD8(+/-) DEGs with 
      those found in a transcriptome analysis carried out by another group using cerebral 
      organoids derived from a family with idiopathic ASD. Remarkably, the top DEG in our 
      respective studies was the non-coding RNA DLX6-AS1, which was markedly upregulated 
      in both studies; DLX6-AS1 regulates the expression of members of the DLX 
      (distal-less homeobox) gene family. DLX1 was also upregulated in both studies. DLX 
      genes code for transcription factors that play a key role in GABAergic interneuron 
      differentiation. Significant overlap was also found in a transcriptome study carried 
      out by another group using iPS cell-derived neurons from patients with BD, a 
      condition characterized by dysregulated WNT/β-catenin signaling in a subgroup of 
      affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings show that distinct ASD, SZ, 
      and BD candidate genes converge on common molecular targets-an important 
      consideration for developing novel therapeutics in genetically heterogeneous complex 
      traits.

AB  - Both transcriptional regulation and signaling pathways play crucial roles in 
      neuronal differentiation and plasticity. Caenorhabditis elegans possesses 19 
      GABAergic motor neurons (MNs) called D MNs, which are divided into two subgroups: DD 
      and VD. DD, but not VD, MNs reverse their cellular polarity in a developmental 
      process called respecification. UNC-30 and UNC-55 are two critical transcription 
      factors in D MNs. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation with CRISPR/Cas9 knockin of 
      GFP fusion, we uncovered the global targets of UNC-30 and UNC-55. UNC-30 and UNC-55 
      are largely converged to regulate over 1,300 noncoding and coding genes, and genes 
      in multiple biological processes, including cAMP metabolism, are co-regulated. 
      Increase in cAMP levels may serve as a timing signal for respecification, whereas 
      UNC-55 regulates genes such as pde-4 to keep the cAMP levels low in VD. Other genes 
      modulating DD respecification such as lin-14, irx-1, and oig-1 are also found to 
      affect cAMP levels.

TI  - Functional analysis of bovine interleukin-10 receptor alpha in response to 
      Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis lysate using CRISPR/Cas9.
PG  - 121
LID - 10.1186/s12863-020-00925-4 [doi]
LID - 121
AB  - BACKGROUND: The interleukin-10 receptor alpha (IL10RA) gene codes for the alpha 
      chain of the IL-10 receptor which binds the cytokine IL-10. IL-10 is an 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine with immunoregulatory function during the pathogenesis of 
      many inflammatory disorders in livestock, including Johne's disease (JD). JD is a 
      chronic enteritis in cattle caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 
      (MAP) and is responsible for significant economic losses to the dairy industry. 
      Several candidate genes including IL10RA have been found to be associated with JD. 
      The aim of this study was to better understand the functional significance of IL10RA 
      in the context of immune stimulation with MAP cell wall lysate. RESULTS: An IL10RA 
      knock out (KO) bovine mammary epithelial cell (MAC-T) line was generated using the 
      CRISPR/cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic 
      Repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) gene editing system. These IL10RA KO cells were 
      stimulated with the immune stimulant MAP lysate +/- IL-10, or with LPS as a positive 
      control. In comparison to unedited cells, relative quantification of immune-related 
      genes after stimulation revealed that knocking out IL10RA resulted in upregulation 
      of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression (TNFA, IL1A, IL1B and IL6) and 
      downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator 
      of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling. At the protein level knocking out IL10RA 
      also resulted in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines - TNF-α and IL-6 and 
      chemokines - IL-8, CCL2 and CCL4, relative to unedited cells. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      findings of this study illustrate the broad and significant effects of knocking out 
      the IL10RA gene in enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and further 
      support the immunoregulatory role of IL10RA in eliciting an anti-inflammatory 
      response as well as its potential functional involvement during the immune response 
      associated with JD.

TI  - The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity 
      Stress Response.
PG  - 1760-1773
LID - 10.1104/pp.17.01332 [doi]
AB  - Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse 
      biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants. 
      Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor 
      (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In this 
      study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) 
      control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 
      different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt 
      tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which 
      HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, 
      hda19 plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while hda5/14/15/18 plants 
      exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the 
      effect of HDA19 deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that 
      of HDA5/14/15/18 deficiencies. In hda19 plants, the expression levels of stress 
      tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein 
      aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid 
      signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these 
      elements was up-regulated in the hda5/14/15/18 plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by 
      genome editing in the hda5/14/15/18 plants enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that 
      suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs 
      in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs 
      that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from salinity stress 
      regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal 
      regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.

AB  - Non-coding regions amplified beyond oncogene borders have largely been ignored. 
      Using a computational approach, we find signatures of significant co-amplification 
      of non-coding DNA beyond the boundaries of amplified oncogenes across five cancer 
      types. In glioblastoma, EGFR is preferentially co-amplified with its two endogenous 
      enhancer elements active in the cell type of origin. These regulatory elements, 
      their contacts, and their contribution to cell fitness are preserved on high-level 
      circular extrachromosomal DNA amplifications. Interrogating the locus with a CRISPR 
      interference screening approach reveals a diversity of additional elements that 
      impact cell fitness. The pattern of fitness dependencies mirrors the rearrangement 
      of regulatory elements and accompanying rewiring of the chromatin topology on the 
      extrachromosomal amplicon. Our studies indicate that oncogene amplifications are 
      shaped by regulatory dependencies in the non-coding genome.

TI  - Biallelic Deletion of Pxdn in Mice Leads to Anophthalmia and Severe Eye 
      Malformation.

AB  - Peroxidasin (PXDN) is a unique peroxidase containing extracellular matrix motifs and 
      stabilizes collagen IV networks by forming sulfilimine crosslinks. PXDN gene 
      knockout in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and Drosophila results in the demise 
      at the embryonic and larval stages. PXDN mutations lead to severe eye disorders, 
      including microphthalmia, cataract, glaucoma, and anterior segment dysgenesis in 
      humans and mice. To investigate how PXDN loss of function affects organ development, 
      we generated Pxdn knockout mice by deletion of exon 1 and its 5' upstream sequences 
      of the Pxdn gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Loss of both PXDN expression and 
      collagen IV sulfilimine cross-links was detected only in the homozygous mice, which 
      showed completely or almost closed eyelids with small eyes, having no apparent 
      external morphological defects in other organs. In histological analysis of eye 
      tissues, the homozygous mice had extreme defects in eye development, including no 
      eyeballs or drastically disorganized eye structures, whereas the heterozygous mice 
      showed normal eye structure. Visual function tests also revealed no obvious 
      functional abnormalities in the eyes between heterozygous mice and wild-type mice. 
      Thus, these results suggest that PXDN activity is essential in eye development, and 
      also indicate that a single allele of Pxdn gene is sufficient for eye-structure 
      formation and normal visual function.

PG  - 3333-3348
LID - 10.1002/bit.27165 [doi]
AB  - Considerable attention has been given to the development of robust fermentation 
      processes, but microbial contamination and phage infection remain deadly threats 
      that need to be addressed. In this study, a robust Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain 
      was successfully constructed by simultaneously introducing a nitrogen and phosphorus 
      (N&P) system in combination with a CRISPR/Cas9 system. The N&P metabolic pathways 
      were able to express formamidase and phosphite dehydrogenase in the host cell, thus 
      enabled cell growth in auxotrophic 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid medium with 
      formamide and phosphite as nitrogen and phosphorus sources, respectively. N&P 
      metabolic pathways also allowed efficient expression of heterologous proteins, such 
      as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and chitinase, while contaminating bacteria or 
      yeast species could hardly survive in this medium. The host strain was further 
      engineered by exploiting the CRISPR/Cas9 system to enhance the resistance against 
      phage attack. The resultant strain was able to grow in the presence of T7 phage at a 
      concentration of up to 2 × 10(7) plaque-forming units/ml and produce GFP with a 
      yield of up to 30 μg/10(9) colony-forming units, exhibiting significant advantages 
      over conventional engineered E. coli. This newly engineered, robust E. coli 
      BL21(DE3) strain therefore shows great potential for future applications in 
      industrial fermentation.

AB  - Precise and efficient manipulation of genes is crucial for understanding the 
      molecular mechanisms that govern human hematopoiesis and for developing novel 
      therapies for diseases of the blood and immune system. Current methods do not enable 
      precise engineering of complex genotypes that can be easily tracked in a mixed 
      population of cells. We describe a method to multiplex homologous recombination (HR) 
      in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and primary human T cells by 
      combining rAAV6 donor delivery and the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered as 
      ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). In addition, the use of reporter genes allows 
      FACS-purification and tracking of cells that have had multiple alleles or loci 
      modified by HR. We believe this method will enable broad applications not only to 
      the study of human hematopoietic gene function and networks, but also to perform 
      sophisticated synthetic biology to develop innovative engineered stem cell-based 
      therapeutics.

TI  - The p38α Stress Kinase Suppresses Aneuploidy Tolerance by Inhibiting Hif-1α.
PG  - 749-760.e6
LID - S2211-1247(18)31505-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.09.060 [doi]
AB  - Deviating from the normal karyotype dramatically changes gene dosage, in turn 
      decreasing the robustness of biological networks. Consequently, aneuploidy is poorly 
      tolerated by normal somatic cells and acts as a barrier to transformation. 
      Paradoxically, however, karyotype heterogeneity drives tumor evolution and the 
      emergence of therapeutic drug resistance. To better understand how cancer cells 
      tolerate aneuploidy, we focused on the p38 stress response kinase. We show here that 
      p38-deficient cells upregulate glycolysis and avoid post-mitotic apoptosis, leading 
      to the emergence of aneuploid subclones. We also show that p38 deficiency 
      upregulates the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Hif-1α and that inhibiting 
      Hif-1α restores apoptosis in p38-deficent cells. Because hypoxia and aneuploidy are 
      both barriers to tumor progression, the ability of Hif-1α to promote cell survival 
      following chromosome missegregation raises the possibility that aneuploidy tolerance 
      coevolves with adaptation to hypoxia.

TI  - A proteomics approach for the identification of cullin-9 (CUL9) related signaling 
      pathways in induced pluripotent stem cell models.
PG  - e0248000
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0248000 [doi]
LID - e0248000
AB  - CUL9 is a non-canonical and poorly characterized member of the largest family of E3 
      ubiquitin ligases known as the Cullin RING ligases (CRLs). Most CRLs play a critical 
      role in developmental processes, however, the role of CUL9 in neuronal development 
      remains elusive. We determined that deletion or depletion of CUL9 protein causes 
      aberrant formation of neural rosettes, an in vitro model of early neuralization. In 
      this study, we applied mass spectrometric approaches in human pluripotent stem cells 
      (hPSCs) and neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) to identify CUL9 related signaling 
      pathways that may contribute to this phenotype. Through LC-MS/MS analysis of 
      immunoprecipitated endogenous CUL9, we identified several subunits of the APC/C, a 
      major cell cycle regulator, as potential CUL9 interacting proteins. Knockdown of the 
      APC/C adapter protein FZR1 resulted in a significant increase in CUL9 protein 
      levels, however, CUL9 does not appear to affect protein abundance of APC/C subunits 
      and adapters or alter cell cycle progression. Quantitative proteomic analysis of 
      CUL9 KO hPSCs and hNPCs identified protein networks related to metabolic, ubiquitin 
      degradation, and transcriptional regulation pathways that are disrupted by CUL9 
      deletion in both hPSCs. No significant changes in oxygen consumption rates or ATP 
      production were detected in either cell type. The results of our study build on 
      current evidence that CUL9 may have unique functions in different cell types and 
      that compensatory mechanisms may contribute to the difficulty of identifying CUL9 
      substrates.

AB  - The field of mammalian synthetic biology is expanding quickly, and technologies for 
      engineering large synthetic gene circuits are increasingly accessible. However, for 
      mammalian cell engineering, traditional tissue culture methods are slow and 
      cumbersome, and are not suited for high-throughput characterization measurements. 
      Here we have utilized mammalian cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) assays using HeLa 
      cell extracts and liquid handling automation as an alternative to tissue culture and 
      flow cytometry-based measurements. Our CFPS assays take a few hours, and we have 
      established optimized protocols for small-volume reactions using automated acoustic 
      liquid handling technology. As a proof-of-concept, we characterized diverse types of 
      genetic regulation in CFPS, including T7 constitutive promoter variants, internal 
      ribosomal entry sites (IRES) constitutive translation-initiation sequence variants, 
      CRISPR/dCas9-mediated transcription repression, and L7Ae-mediated translation 
      repression. Our data shows simple regulatory elements for use in mammalian cells can 
      be quickly prototyped in a CFPS model system.

      Ganglion of Ciona.

AB  - The central nervous system of the Ciona larva contains only 177 neurons. The precise 
      regulation of neuron subtype-specific morphogenesis and differentiation observed 
      during the formation of this minimal connectome offers a unique opportunity to 
      dissect gene regulatory networks underlying chordate neurodevelopment. Here we 
      compare the transcriptomes of two very distinct neuron types in the hindbrain/spinal 
      cord homolog of Ciona, the Motor Ganglion (MG): the Descending decussating neuron 
      (ddN, proposed homolog of Mauthner Cells in vertebrates) and the MG Interneuron 2 
      (MGIN2). Both types are invariantly represented by a single bilaterally symmetric 
      left/right pair of cells in every larva. Supernumerary ddNs and MGIN2s were 
      generated in synchronized embryos and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell 
      sorting for transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 
      ddN- and MGIN2-specific enrichment of a wide range of genes, including many encoding 
      potential "effectors" of subtype-specific morphological and functional traits. More 
      specifically, we identified the upregulation of centrosome-associated, 
      microtubule-stabilizing/bundling proteins and extracellular guidance cues part of a 
      single intrinsic regulatory program that might underlie the unique polarization of 
      the ddNs, the only descending MG neurons that cross the midline. Consistent with our 
      predictions, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated, tissue-specific elimination of two such candidate 
      effectors, Efcab6-related and Netrin1, impaired ddN polarized axon outgrowth across 
      the midline.

AB  - Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screening was applied to investigate novel targets 
      in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). 20 genes and 2 miRNAs 
      have been selected by total reads of sgRNA and sgRNA diversity, which has been 
      further validated in imatinib-resistant GIST cells by CCK8 and qPCR analysis. Our 
      study has finally revealed 9 genes (DBP, NR3C1, TCF12, TP53, ZNF12, SOCS6, ZFP36, 
      ACYP1, and DRD1) involved in imatinib-resistant GIST-T1 cells. TP53 and SOCS6 may be 
      the most promising candidate genes for imatinib-resistance due to the possible 
      signaling pathway, such as apoptosis pathway and Wnt signaling pathway, JAK-STAT 
      signaling pathway. It is necessary to perform more studies to discover novel targets 
      in imatinib-resistant GIST, including DBP, NR3C1, TCF12, ZNF12, ZFP36, ACYP1 and 
      DRD1.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by 
      pathologic T cell-B cell interactions and autoantibody production. Defining the T 
      cell populations that drive B cell responses in SLE may enable design of therapies 
      that specifically target pathologic cell subsets. Here, we evaluated the phenotypes 
      of CD4+ T cells in the circulation of 52 SLE patients drawn from multiple cohorts 
      and identified a highly expanded PD-1hiCXCR5-CD4+ T cell population. Cytometric, 
      transcriptomic, and functional assays demonstrated that PD-1hiCXCR5-CD4+ T cells 
      from SLE patients are T peripheral helper (Tph) cells, a CXCR5- T cell population 
      that stimulates B cell responses via IL-21. The frequency of Tph cells, but not T 
      follicular helper (Tfh) cells, correlated with both clinical disease activity and 
      the frequency of CD11c+ B cells in SLE patients. PD-1hiCD4+ T cells were found 
      within lupus nephritis kidneys and correlated with B cell numbers in the kidney. 
      Both IL-21 neutralization and CRISPR-mediated deletion of MAF abrogated the ability 
      of Tph cells to induce memory B cell differentiation into plasmablasts in vitro. 
      These findings identify Tph cells as a highly expanded T cell population in SLE and 
      suggest a key role for Tph cells in stimulating pathologic B cell responses.

TI  - Personalized logical models to investigate cancer response to BRAF treatments in 
      melanomas and colorectal cancers.
PG  - e1007900

LID - e1007900
AB  - The study of response to cancer treatments has benefited greatly from the 
      contribution of different omics data but their interpretation is sometimes 
      difficult. Some mathematical models based on prior biological knowledge of signaling 
      pathways facilitate this interpretation but often require fitting of their 
      parameters using perturbation data. We propose a more qualitative mechanistic 
      approach, based on logical formalism and on the sole mapping and interpretation of 
      omics data, and able to recover differences in sensitivity to gene inhibition 
      without model training. This approach is showcased by the study of BRAF inhibition 
      in patients with melanomas and colorectal cancers who experience significant 
      differences in sensitivity despite similar omics profiles. We first gather 
      information from literature and build a logical model summarizing the regulatory 
      network of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway surrounding BRAF, 
      with factors involved in the BRAF inhibition resistance mechanisms. The relevance of 
      this model is verified by automatically assessing that it qualitatively reproduces 
      response or resistance behaviors identified in the literature. Data from over 100 
      melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines are then used to validate the model's 
      ability to explain differences in sensitivity. This generic model is transformed 
      into personalized cell line-specific logical models by integrating the omics 
      information of the cell lines as constraints of the model. The use of mutations 
      alone allows personalized models to correlate significantly with experimental 
      sensitivities to BRAF inhibition, both from drug and CRISPR targeting, and even 
      better with the joint use of mutations and RNA, supporting multi-omics mechanistic 
      models. A comparison of these untrained models with learning approaches highlights 
      similarities in interpretation and complementarity depending on the size of the 
      datasets. This parsimonious pipeline, which can easily be extended to other 
      biological questions, makes it possible to explore the mechanistic causes of the 
      response to treatment, on an individualized basis.

AB  - Resveratrol is a natural product associated with wide-ranging effects in animal and 
      cellular models, including lifespan extension. To identify the genetic target of 
      resveratrol in human cells, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to pinpoint 
      genes that confer sensitivity or resistance to resveratrol. An extensive network of 
      DNA damage response and replicative stress genes exhibited genetic interactions with 
      resveratrol and its analog pterostilbene. These genetic profiles showed similarity 
      to the response to hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase that causes 
      replicative stress. Resveratrol, pterostilbene, and hydroxyurea caused similar 
      depletion of nucleotide pools, inhibition of replication fork progression, and 
      induction of replicative stress. The ability of resveratrol to inhibit cell 
      proliferation and S phase transit was independent of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 
      1, which has been implicated in lifespan extension by resveratrol. These results 
      establish that a primary impact of resveratrol on human cell proliferation is the 
      induction of low-level replicative stress.

AB  - We present scMAGeCK, a computational framework to identify genomic elements 
      associated with multiple expression-based phenotypes in CRISPR/Cas9 functional 
      screening that uses single-cell RNA-seq as readout. scMAGeCK outperforms existing 
      methods, identifies genes and enhancers with known and novel functions in cell 
      proliferation, and enables an unbiased construction of genotype-phenotype network. 
      Single-cell CRISPR screening on mouse embryonic stem cells identifies key genes 
      associated with different pluripotency states. Applying scMAGeCK on multiple 
      datasets, we identify key factors that improve the power of single-cell CRISPR 
      screening. Collectively, scMAGeCK is a novel tool to study genotype-phenotype 
      relationships at a single-cell level.

TI  - CRISPR screening using an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters identifies TMEM41B 
      as a novel autophagy factor.

AB  - The power of forward genetics in yeast is the foundation on which the field of 
      autophagy research firmly stands. Complementary work on autophagy in higher 
      eukaryotes has revealed both the deep conservation of this process, as well as novel 
      mechanisms by which autophagy is regulated in the context of development, immunity, 
      and neuronal homeostasis. The recent emergence of new clustered regularly 
      interspaced palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-based 
      technologies has begun facilitating efforts to define novel autophagy factors and 
      pathways by forward genetic screening in mammalian cells. Here, we set out to 
      develop an expanded toolkit of autophagy reporters amenable to CRISPR/Cas9 
      screening. Genome-wide screening of our reporters in mammalian cells recovered 
      virtually all known autophagy-related (ATG) factors as well as previously 
      uncharacterized factors, including vacuolar protein sorting 37 homolog A (VPS37A), 
      transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 (ALS2), and 
      TMEM41B. To validate this data set, we used quantitative microscopy and biochemical 
      analyses to show that 1 novel hit, TMEM41B, is required for phagophore maturation. 
      TMEM41B is an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein distantly related 
      to the established autophagy factor vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), and our data 
      show that these two factors play related, albeit not fully overlapping, roles in 
      autophagosome biogenesis. In sum, our work uncovers new ATG factors, reveals a 
      malleable network of autophagy receptor genetic interactions, and provides a 
      valuable resource (http://crispr.deniclab.com) for further mining of novel autophagy 
      mechanisms.

TI  - A minor QTL, SG3, encoding an R2R3-MYB protein, negatively controls grain length in 
      rice.
PG  - 2387-2399
LID - 10.1007/s00122-020-03606-z [doi]
AB  - SG3, an R2R3 MYB protein coding gene that tightly linked to a major QTLGS3, 
      negatively regulates grain length while dependent on the status ofGS3in rice. It is 
      often very difficult to isolate a minor QTL that is closely linked to a major QTL in 
      rice. In this study, we focused on the isolation of a minor grain length QTL, small 
      grain 3 (SG3), which is closely linked to the major QTL grain size 3 (GS3). The 
      genetic effect of SG3 on grain length was dependent on GS3 status. Its genetic 
      effect was larger in the presence of nonfunctional sg3 than functional SG3. A large 
      number of near-isogenic F2 plants in which GS3 was fixed with nonfunctional alleles 
      were developed to clone SG3. A gene encoding an R2R3 MYB domain transcriptional 
      regulator was identified as the candidate gene for SG3. SG3 overexpression and 
      knockdown plants showed shortened and elongated grains, respectively, which 
      demonstrated that SG3 acts as a negative regulator of grain length. SG3 was 
      preferentially expressed in panicles after flowering, and SG3 acted as a 
      transcription activator. Comparative sequencing analysis identified a 12-bp 
      insertion in the third exon of NYZ that led to a frameshift and resulted in a 
      premature stop codon. The insertion/deletion was associated with grain length in the 
      presence of functional GS3 in the indica subspecies. SG3 and GS3 were frequently in 
      coupling phase in indica rice, making them good targets for the breeding of 
      cultivars with short or long grains. The isolation of the SG3 MYB gene provides new 
      gene resource and contributes to the regulatory network of grain length in rice.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-based discovery of maize transcription factors regulating male sterility 
      and their functional conservation in plants.
PG  - 1769-1784
LID - 10.1111/pbi.13590 [doi]
AB  - Identifying genic male-sterility (GMS) genes and elucidating their roles are 
      important to unveil plant male reproduction and promote their application in crop 
      breeding. However, compared with Arabidopsis and rice, relatively fewer maize GMS 
      genes have been discovered and little is known about their regulatory pathways 
      underlying anther and pollen development. Here, by sequencing and analysing anther 
      transcriptomes at 11 developmental stages in maize B73, Zheng58 and M6007 inbred 
      lines, 1100 transcription factor (TF) genes were identified to be stably 
      differentially expressed among different developmental stages. Among them, 14 maize 
      TF genes (9 types belonging to five TF families) were selected and performed 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene mutagenesis, and then, 12 genes in eight types, including 
      ZmbHLH51, ZmbHLH122, ZmTGA9-1/-2/-3, ZmTGA10, ZmMYB84, ZmMYB33-1/-2, ZmPHD11 and 
      ZmLBD10/27, were identified as maize new GMS genes by using DNA sequencing, 
      phenotypic and cytological analyses. Notably, ZmTGA9-1/-2/-3 triple-gene mutants and 
      ZmMYB33-1/-2 double-gene mutants displayed complete male sterility, but their 
      double- or single-gene mutants showed male fertility. Similarly, ZmLBD10/27 
      double-gene mutant displayed partial male sterility with 32.18% of aborted pollen 
      grains. In addition, ZmbHLH51 was transcriptionally activated by ZmbHLH122 and their 
      proteins were physically interacted. Molecular markers co-segregating with these GMS 
      mutations were developed to facilitate their application in maize breeding. Finally, 
      all 14-type maize GMS TF genes identified here and reported previously were compared 
      on functional conservation and diversification among maize, rice and Arabidopsis. 
      These findings enrich GMS gene and mutant resources for deeply understanding the 
      regulatory network underlying male fertility and for creating male-sterility lines 
      in maize.

TI  - Biallelic CCM3 mutations cause a clonogenic survival advantage and endothelial cell 
      stiffening.
PG  - 1771-1783
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.14075 [doi]
AB  - CCM3, originally described as PDCD10, regulates blood-brain barrier integrity and 
      vascular maturation in vivo. CCM3 loss-of-function variants predispose to cerebral 
      cavernous malformations (CCM). Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we here present a 
      model which mimics complete CCM3 inactivation in cavernous endothelial cells (ECs) 
      of heterozygous mutation carriers. Notably, we established a viral- and plasmid-free 
      crRNA:tracrRNA:Cas9 ribonucleoprotein approach to introduce homozygous or compound 
      heterozygous loss-of-function CCM3 variants into human ECs and studied the molecular 
      and functional effects of long-term CCM3 inactivation. Induction of apoptosis, 
      sprouting, migration, network and spheroid formation were significantly impaired 
      upon prolonged CCM3 deficiency. Real-time deformability cytometry demonstrated that 
      loss of CCM3 induces profound changes in cell morphology and mechanics: 
      CCM3-deficient ECs have an increased cell area and elastic modulus. Small RNA 
      profiling disclosed that CCM3 modulates the expression of miRNAs that are associated 
      with endothelial ageing. In conclusion, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing 
      provides new insight into the consequences of long-term CCM3 inactivation in human 
      ECs and supports the hypothesis that clonal expansion of CCM3-deficient 
      dysfunctional ECs contributes to CCM formation.

TI  - Interferon regulatory factor 5 and nuclear factor kappa-B exhibit cooperating but 
      also divergent roles in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines important for 
      the development of TH1 and TH17 responses.
PG  - 3097-3113
LID - 10.1111/febs.14600 [doi]
AB  - A large body of data demonstrates that interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and 
      nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) are the two major transcription factors in 
      classically activated macrophages responsible for the transcriptional control of 
      proinflammatory genes. Although recent evidence suggests that IRF5 interacts with 
      certain members of the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, the extent of cooperation and 
      its implications in disease are ambiguous. Since both pathways are known for their 
      strong contributions in TLR8 signaling we used the human monocytic cell line 
      THP-1.Dual, featuring gene reporters for NF-κB and IRFs, to simultaneously study the 
      roles of IRF5 and the NF-κB subunit p65 in TLR8-mediated gene reporter activities. 
      Furthermore, we profiled from these cells the proinflammatory cytokines involved in 
      the differentiation of TH1 and TH17 cells. After ablation of IRF5 and/or p65 we 
      activated the resultant cells with the TLR8 agonists R848 or the 
      psoriasis-associated antimicrobial peptide LL-37 complexed with ssRNA and 
      demonstrate that IRF5 deficiency drastically impairs the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, 
      IL-12, IL-23 and TNFα. In contrast, the lack of p65 impaired only IL-6, IL-12, and 
      IL-23 secretion. Furthermore, we discovered that upon TLR8 stimulation, IRF5 but not 
      NF-κB signaling is essential to provide a cytokine milieu supporting TH1 responses. 
      Additionally, we demonstrate that IRF5 and NF-κB cooperate to provide a cytokine 
      milieu supporting TH17 responses. Therefore, the distinct role of IRF5 in the 
      intricate signaling network downstream of TLR8 may open new treatment options 
      interfering with but not disrupting NF-κB signaling in human diseases.

      hippocampal neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is becoming widespread, however 
      current studies have predominantly focused on dividing cells. It is currently 
      unknown if CRISPR/Cas9 can be used in a postmitotic setting to examine non-cell 
      autonomous/presynaptic phenotypes in the resulting genetically heterogeneous cell 
      population. NEW METHOD: A single CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus was used to transfect a high 
      percentage of primary cultured neurons and target synaptobrevin 2 (Syb2, also called 
      VAMP2). RESULTS: Primary hippocampal cultures infected with the Syb2 targeting virus 
      displayed dramatic reductions in Syb2 protein and immunocytochemical staining. In 
      many boutons Syb2 was completely undetected. These cultures recapitulated the known 
      functional phenotypes of Syb2 knockout neurons, which are non-cell autonomous and 
      presynaptic in origin, indicating that Syb2 was knocked out in a large fraction of 
      neurons. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Previous methods used multiple viruses 
      or sparse transfection methods and only examined cell autonomous or postsynaptic 
      phenotypes. The current method demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used 
      to alter network dynamics by removing or lowering the target gene from a majority of 
      cells in the culture. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of CRISPR/Cas9 system and single 
      high efficiency lentivirus infection can be used to examine non-cell autonomous and 
      presynaptic phenotypes in postmitotic neurons.

AB  - Macromolecular complexes govern the majority of biological processes and are of 
      great biomedical relevance as factors that perturb interaction networks underlie a 
      number of diseases, and inhibition of protein-protein interactions is a common 
      strategy in drug discovery. Genome editing technologies enable precise modifications 
      in protein coding genes in mammalian cells, offering the possibility to introduce 
      affinity tags or fluorescent reporters for proteomic or imaging applications in the 
      bona fide cellular context. Here we describe a streamlined procedure which uses the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system and a double-stranded donor plasmid for efficient generation of 
      homozygous endogenously GFP-tagged human cell lines. Establishing cellular models 
      that preserve native genomic regulation of the target protein is instrumental to 
      investigate protein localization and dynamics using fluorescence imaging but also to 
      affinity purify associated protein complexes using anti-GFP antibodies or 
      nanobodies.

AB  - A propensity for rewiring genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks, thus enabling 
      sustained cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, and the ability to evade the 
      immune system, is vital to cancer cell propagation. An increased understanding of 
      how this is achieved is critical for identifying or improving therapeutic 
      interventions. In this study, using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) human cell lines 
      and a custom CRISPR/Cas9 screening platform, we identify the H3K9 methyltransferase 
      SETDB1 as a novel, negative regulator of innate immunity. SETDB1 is overexpressed in 
      many cancers, and loss of this gene in AML cells triggers desilencing of 
      retrotransposable elements that leads to the production of double-stranded RNAs 
      (dsRNAs). This is coincident with induction of a type I interferon response and 
      apoptosis through the dsRNA-sensing pathway. Collectively, our findings establish a 
      unique gene regulatory axis that cancer cells can exploit to circumvent the immune 
      system.

AB  - With the genetic portraits of all major human malignancies now available, we next 
      face the challenge of characterizing the function of mutated genes, their downstream 
      targets, interactions and molecular networks. Moreover, poorly understood at the 
      functional level are also non-mutated but dysregulated genomes, epigenomes or 
      transcriptomes. Breakthroughs in manipulative mouse genetics offer new opportunities 
      to probe the interplay of molecules, cells and systemic signals underlying disease 
      pathogenesis in higher organisms. Herein, we review functional screening strategies 
      in mice using genetic perturbation and chemical mutagenesis. We outline the spectrum 
      of genetic tools that exist, such as transposons, CRISPR and RNAi and describe 
      discoveries emerging from their use. Genome-wide or targeted screens are being used 
      to uncover genomic and regulatory landscapes in oncogenesis, metastasis or drug 
      resistance. Versatile screening systems support experimentation in diverse genetic 
      and spatio-temporal settings to integrate molecular, cellular or environmental 
      context-dependencies. We also review the combination of in vivo screening and 
      barcoding strategies to study genetic interactions and quantitative cancer dynamics 
      during tumour evolution. These scalable functional genomics approaches are 
      transforming our ability to interrogate complex biological systems.

TI  - The maize heterotrimeric G protein β subunit controls shoot meristem development and 
      immune responses.
PG  - 1799-1805
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1917577116 [doi]
AB  - Heterotrimeric G proteins are important transducers of receptor signaling, 
      functioning in plants with CLAVATA receptors in controlling shoot meristem size and 
      with pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors in basal immunity. However, 
      whether specific members of the heterotrimeric complex potentiate cross-talk between 
      development and defense, and the extent to which these functions are conserved 
      across species, have not yet been addressed. Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out 
      the maize G protein β subunit gene (Gβ) and found that the mutants are lethal, 
      differing from those in Arabidopsis, in which homologous mutants have normal growth 
      and fertility. We show that lethality is caused not by a specific developmental 
      arrest, but by autoimmunity. We used a genetic diversity screen to suppress the 
      lethal Gβ phenotype and also identified a maize Gβ allele with weak autoimmune 
      responses but strong development phenotypes. Using these tools, we show that Gβ 
      controls meristem size in maize, acting epistatically with G protein α subunit gene 
      (Gα), suggesting that Gβ and Gα function in a common signaling complex. Furthermore, 
      we used an association study to show that natural variation in Gβ influences maize 
      kernel row number, an important agronomic trait. Our results demonstrate the dual 
      role of Gβ in immunity and development in a cereal crop and suggest that it 
      functions in cross-talk between these competing signaling networks. Therefore, 
      modification of Gβ has the potential to optimize the trade-off between growth and 
      defense signaling to improve agronomic production.

TI  - Establishment and application of multiplexed CRISPR interference system in Bacillus 
      licheniformis.
PG  - 391-403
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-10230-5 [doi]
AB  - Bacillus licheniformis has been regarded as an outstanding microbial cell factory 
      for the production of biochemicals and enzymes. Due to lack of genetic tools to 
      repress gene expression, metabolic engineering and gene function elucidation are 
      limited in this microbe. In this study, an integrated CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) 
      system was constructed in B. licheniformis. Several endogenous genes, including 
      yvmC, cypX, alsD, pta, ldh, and essential gene rpsC, were severed as the targets to 
      test this CRISPRi system, and the repression efficiencies were ranged from 45.02 to 
      94.00%. Moreover, the multiple genes were simultaneously repressed with high 
      efficiency using this CRISPRi system. As a case study, the genes involved in 
      by-product synthetic and L-valine degradation pathways were selected as the silence 
      targets to redivert metabolic flux toward L-valine synthesis. Repression of 
      acetolactate decarboxylase (alsD) and leucine dehydrogenase (bcd) led to 90.48% and 
      80.09 % increases in L-valine titer, respectively. Compared with the control strain 
      DW9i△leuA (1.47 g/L and 1.79 g/L), the L-valine titers of combinatorial strain 
      DW9i△leuA/pHYi-alsD-bcd were increased by 1.27-fold and 2.89-fold, respectively, in 
      flask and bioreactor. Collectively, this work provides a feasible approach for 
      multiplex metabolic engineering and functional genome studies of B. licheniformis.

TI  - OsMYB108 loss-of-function enriches p-coumaroylated and tricin lignin units in rice 
      cell walls.
PG  - 975-987

AB  - Breeding approaches to enrich lignins in biomass could be beneficial to improving 
      the biorefinery process because lignins increase biomass heating value and represent 
      a potent source of valuable aromatic chemicals. However, despite the fact that 
      grasses are promising lignocellulose feedstocks, limited information is yet 
      available for molecular-breeding approaches to upregulate lignin biosynthesis in 
      grass species. In this study, we generated lignin-enriched transgenic rice (Oryza 
      sativa), a model grass species, via targeted mutagenesis of the transcriptional 
      repressor OsMYB108 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. The OsMYB108-knockout 
      rice mutants displayed increased expressions of lignin biosynthetic genes and 
      enhanced lignin deposition in culm cell walls. Chemical and two-dimensional nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses revealed that the mutant cell walls were 
      preferentially enriched in γ-p-coumaroylated and tricin lignin units, both of which 
      are typical and unique components in grass lignins. NMR analysis also showed that 
      the relative abundances of major lignin linkage types were altered in the OsMYB108 
      mutants.

TI  - CRISPRi-Guided Metabolic Flux Engineering for Enhanced Protopanaxadiol Production in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222111836 [doi]
LID - 11836
AB  - Protopanaxadiol (PPD), an aglycon found in several dammarene-type ginsenosides, has 
      high potency as a pharmaceutical. Nevertheless, application of these ginsenosides 
      has been limited because of the high production cost due to the rare content of PPD 
      in Panax ginseng and a long cultivation time (4-6 years). For the biological mass 
      production of the PPD, de novo biosynthetic pathways for PPD were introduced in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the metabolic flux toward the target molecule was 
      restructured to avoid competition for carbon sources between native metabolic 
      pathways and de novo biosynthetic pathways producing PPD in S. cerevisiae. Here, we 
      report a CRISPRi (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
      interference)-based customized metabolic flux system which downregulates the 
      lanosterol (a competing metabolite of dammarenediol-II (DD-II)) synthase in S. 
      cerevisiae. With the CRISPRi-mediated suppression of lanosterol synthase and 
      diversion of lanosterol to DD-II and PPD in S. cerevisiae, we increased PPD 
      production 14.4-fold in shake-flask fermentation and 5.7-fold in a long-term 
      batch-fed fermentation.

AB  - Adaptive evolution to cellular stress is a process implicated in a wide range of 
      biological and clinical phenomena. Two major routes of adaptation have been 
      identified: non-genetic changes, which allow expression of different phenotypes in 
      novel environments, and genetic variation achieved by selection of fitter 
      phenotypes. While these processes are broadly accepted, their temporal and epistatic 
      features in the context of cellular evolution and emerging drug resistance are 
      contentious. In this manuscript, we generated hypomorphic alleles of the essential 
      nuclear pore complex (NPC) gene NUP58. By dissecting early and long-term mechanisms 
      of adaptation in independent clones, we observed that early physiological adaptation 
      correlated with transcriptome rewiring and upregulation of genes known to interact 
      with the NPC; long-term adaptation and fitness recovery instead occurred via focal 
      amplification of NUP58 and restoration of mutant protein expression. These data 
      support the concept that early phenotypic plasticity allows later acquisition of 
      genetic adaptations to a specific impairment. We propose this approach as a genetic 
      model to mimic targeted drug therapy in human cells and to dissect mechanisms of 
      adaptation.

TI  - Omics and CRISPR-Cas9 Approaches for Molecular Insight, Functional Gene Analysis, 
      and Stress Tolerance Development in Crops.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22031292 [doi]
LID - 1292
AB  - Plants are regularly exposed to biotic and abiotic stresses that adversely affect 
      agricultural production. Omics has gained momentum in the last two decades, fueled 
      by statistical methodologies, computational capabilities, mass spectrometry, 
      nucleic-acid sequencing, and peptide-sequencing platforms. Functional 
      genomics-especially metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics-have contributed 
      substantially to plant molecular responses to stress. Recent progress in reverse and 
      forward genetics approaches have mediated high-throughput techniques for identifying 
      stress-related genes. Furthermore, web-based genetic databases have mediated 
      bioinformatics techniques for detecting families of stress-tolerant genes. Gene 
      ontology (GO) databases provide information on the gene product's functional 
      features and help with the computational estimation of gene function. Functional 
      omics data from multiple platforms are useful for positional cloning. 
      Stress-tolerant plants have been engineered using stress response genes, regulatory 
      networks, and pathways. The genome-editing tool, CRISPR-Cas9, reveals the functional 
      features of several parts of the plant genome. Current developments in CRISPR, such 
      as de novo meristem induction genome-engineering in dicots and temperature-tolerant 
      LbCas12a/CRISPR, enable greater DNA insertion precision. This review discusses 
      functional omics for molecular insight and CRISPR-Cas9-based validation of gene 
      function in crop plants. Omics and CRISPR-Cas9 are expected to garner knowledge on 
      molecular systems and gene function and stress-tolerant crop production.

TI  - Acrolein-stressed threshold adaptation alters the molecular and metabolic bases of 
      an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to improve glutathione production.

LID - 4506
AB  - Acrolein (Acr) was used as a selection agent to improve the glutathione (GSH) 
      overproduction of the prototrophic strain W303-1b/FGP(PT). After two rounds of 
      adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE), an unexpected result was obtained wherein 
      identical GSH production was observed in the selected isolates. Then, a threshold 
      selection mechanism of Acr-stressed adaption was clarified based on the formation of 
      an Acr-GSH adduct, and a diffusion coefficient (0.36 ± 0.02 
      μmol·min(-1)·OD(600)(-1)) was calculated. Metabolomic analysis was carried out to 
      reveal the molecular bases that triggered GSH overproduction. The results indicated 
      that all three precursors (glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly) and cysteine (Cys)) 
      needed for GSH synthesis were at a relativity higher concentration in the evolved 
      strain and that the accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and cystathionine might 
      promote Cys synthesis and then improve GSH production. In addition to GSH and Cys, 
      it was observed that other non-protein thiols and molecules related to ATP 
      generation were at obviously different levels. To divert the accumulated thiols to 
      GSH biosynthesis, combinatorial strategies, including deletion of cystathionine 
      β-lyase (STR3), overexpression of cystathionine γ-lyase (CYS3) and cystathionine 
      β-synthase (CYS4), and reduction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) through 
      up-regulation of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), were also investigated.

TI  - Activation of SAT1 engages polyamine metabolism with p53-mediated ferroptotic 
      responses.
PG  - E6806-E6812
AB  - Although p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis remain critical 
      barriers to cancer development, the emerging role of p53 in cell metabolism, 
      oxidative responses, and ferroptotic cell death has been a topic of great interest. 
      Nevertheless, it is unclear how p53 orchestrates its activities in multiple 
      metabolic pathways into tumor suppressive effects. Here, we identified the SAT1 
      (spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase 1) gene as a transcription target of 
      p53. SAT1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism critically involved in 
      the conversion of spermidine and spermine back to putrescine. Surprisingly, we found 
      that activation of SAT1 expression induces lipid peroxidation and sensitizes cells 
      to undergo ferroptosis upon reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced stress, which also 
      leads to suppression of tumor growth in xenograft tumor models. Notably, SAT1 
      expression is down-regulated in human tumors, and CRISPR-cas9-mediated knockout of 
      SAT1 expression partially abrogates p53-mediated ferroptosis. Moreover, SAT1 
      induction is correlated with the expression levels of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase 
      (ALOX15), and SAT1-induced ferroptosis is significantly abrogated in the presence of 
      PD146176, a specific inhibitor of ALOX15. Thus, our findings uncover a metabolic 
      target of p53 involved in ferroptotic cell death and provide insight into the 
      regulation of polyamine metabolism and ferroptosis-mediated tumor suppression.

TI  - Muscle differentiation induced by p53 signaling pathway-related genes in 
      myostatin-knockout quail myoblasts.
PG  - 9531-9540
LID - 10.1007/s11033-020-05935-0 [doi]
AB  - The myostatin (MSTN) gene is of interest in the livestock industry because mutations 
      in this gene are closely related to growth performance and muscle differentiation. 
      Thus, in this study, we established MSTN knockout (KO) quail myoblasts (QM7) and 
      investigated the regulatory pathway of the myogenic differentiation process. We used 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to generate 
      MSTN KO QM7 cells and subsequently isolated a single cell-derived MSTN KO QM7 
      subline with 10- and 16-nucleotide deletions that induced translational frameshift 
      mutations. The differentiation capacity and proliferation rate of MSTN KO QM7 cells 
      were enhanced. We conducted next-generation-sequencing (NGS) analysis to compare the 
      global gene expression profiles of wild-type (WT) QM7 and MSTN KO QM7 cells. 
      Intriguingly, NGS expression profiles showed different expression patterns of p21 
      and p53 in MSTN KO QM7 cells. Moreover, we identified downregulated expression 
      patterns of leukemia inhibitory factor and DNA Damage Inducible Transcript 4, which 
      are genes in the p53 signaling pathway. Using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis 
      and western blotting, we concluded that p53-related genes promote the cell cycle by 
      upregulating p21 and enhancing muscle differentiation in MSTN KO QM7 cells. These 
      results could be applied to improve economic traits in commercial poultry by 
      regulating MSTN-related networks.

TI  - IMiDs prime myeloma cells for daratumumab-mediated cytotoxicity through loss of 
      Ikaros and Aiolos.
PG  - 2166-2178
LID - 10.1182/blood-2018-05-850727 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that the immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) lead to the 
      degradation of the transcription factors Ikaros and Aiolos. However, why their loss 
      subsequently leads to multiple myeloma (MM) cell death remains unclear. Using 
      CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we have deleted IKZF1/Ikaros and IKZF3/Aiolos in human 
      MM cell lines to gain further insight into their downstream gene regulatory 
      networks. Inactivation of either factor alone recapitulates the cell intrinsic 
      action of the IMiDs, resulting in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. 
      Furthermore, evaluation of the transcriptional changes resulting from their loss 
      demonstrates striking overlap with lenalidomide treatment. This was not dependent on 
      reduction of the IRF4-MYC "axis," as neither protein was consistently downregulated, 
      despite cell death occurring, and overexpression of either factor failed to rescue 
      for Ikaros loss. Importantly, Ikaros and Aiolos repress the expression of 
      interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including CD38, and their loss led to the 
      activation of an interferon-like response, contributing to MM cell death. 
      Ikaros/Aiolos repressed CD38 expression through interaction with the nucleosome 
      remodeling and deacetylase complex in MM. IMiD-induced loss of Ikaros or treatment 
      with interferon resulted in an upregulation of CD38 surface expression on MM cells, 
      priming for daratumumab-induced NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular 
      cytotoxicity. These results give further insight into the mechanism of action of the 
      IMiDs and provide mechanistic rationale for combination with anti-CD38 monoclonal 
      antibodies.

AB  - Seizures often herald the clinical appearance of gliomas or appear at later stages. 
      Dissecting their precise evolution and cellular pathogenesis in brain malignancies 
      could inform the development of staged therapies for these highly pharmaco-resistant 
      epilepsies. Studies in immunodeficient xenograft models have identified local 
      interneuron loss and excess glial glutamate release as chief contributors to network 
      disinhibition, but how hyperexcitability in the peritumoral microenvironment evolves 
      in an immunocompetent brain is unclear. We generated gliomas in WT mice via in utero 
      deletion of key tumor suppressor genes and serially monitored cortical 
      epileptogenesis during tumor infiltration with in vivo electrophysiology and GCAMP7 
      calcium imaging, revealing a reproducible progression from hyperexcitability to 
      convulsive seizures. Long before seizures, coincident with loss of inhibitory cells 
      and their protective scaffolding, gain of glial glutamate antiporter xCT expression, 
      and reactive astrocytosis, we detected local Iba1+ microglial inflammation that 
      intensified and later extended far beyond tumor boundaries. Hitherto unrecognized 
      episodes of cortical spreading depolarization that arose frequently from the 
      peritumoral region may provide a mechanism for transient neurological deficits. 
      Early blockade of glial xCT activity inhibited later seizures, and genomic reduction 
      of host brain excitability by deleting MapT suppressed molecular markers of 
      epileptogenesis and seizures. Our studies confirmed xenograft tumor-driven 
      pathobiology and revealed early and late components of tumor-related epileptogenesis 
      in a genetically tractable, immunocompetent mouse model of glioma, allowing the 
      complex dissection of tumor versus host pathogenic seizure mechanisms.

AB  - DNA damage response (DDR) is critically important for cell survival, genome 
      maintenance, and its defect has been exploited therapeutically in cancer treatment. 
      Many DDR-targeting agents have been generated and have entered the clinic and/or 
      clinical trials. In order to provide a global and unbiased view of DDR network, we 
      designed a focused CRISPR library targeting 365 DDR genes and performed CRISPR 
      screens on the responses to several DDR inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents in 293A 
      cells. With these screens, we determined responsive pathways enriched under 
      treatment with different types of small-molecule agents. Additionally, we showed 
      that POLE3/4-deficient cells displayed enhanced sensitivity to an ATR inhibitor, a 
      PARP inhibitor, and camptothecin. Moreover, by performing DDR screens in isogenic 
      TP53 wild-type and TP53 knock-out cell lines, our results suggest that the 
      performance of our CRISPR DDR dropout screens is independent of TP53 status. 
      Collectively, our findings indicate that CRISPR DDR screens can be used to identify 
      potential targets of small-molecule drugs and reveal that TP53 status does not 
      affect the outcome of these screens.

TI  - YAP antagonizes innate antiviral immunity and is targeted for lysosomal degradation 
      through IKKɛ-mediated phosphorylation.
PG  - 733-743
LID - 10.1038/ni.3744 [doi]
AB  - The transcription regulator YAP controls organ size by regulating cell growth, 
      proliferation and apoptosis. However, whether YAP has a role in innate antiviral 
      immunity is largely unknown. Here we found that YAP negatively regulated an 
      antiviral immune response. YAP deficiency resulted in enhanced innate immunity, a 
      diminished viral load, and morbidity in vivo. YAP blocked dimerization of the 
      transcription factor IRF3 and impeded translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus after 
      viral infection. Notably, virus-activated kinase IKKɛ phosphorylated YAP at Ser403 
      and thereby triggered degradation of YAP in lysosomes and, consequently, relief of 
      YAP-mediated inhibition of the cellular antiviral response. These findings not only 
      establish YAP as a modulator of the activation of IRF3 but also identify a 
      previously unknown regulatory mechanism independent of the kinases Hippo and LATS 
      via which YAP is controlled by the innate immune pathway.

TI  - Transcriptomic and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies reveal FOXA2 as a tumor suppressor gene 
      in pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with low survival 
      rates and limited therapeutic options. Thus elucidation of signaling pathways 
      involved in PDAC pathogenesis is essential for identifying novel potential 
      therapeutic gene targets. Here, we used a systems approach to elucidate those 
      pathways by integrating gene and microRNA profiling analyses together with 
      CRISPR/Cas9 technology to identify novel transcription factors involved in PDAC 
      pathogenesis. FOXA2 transcription factor was found to be significantly downregulated 
      in PDAC relative to control pancreatic tissues. Functional experiments revealed that 
      FOXA2 has a tumor suppressor function through inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell 
      growth, migration, invasion, and colony formation. In situ hybridization analysis 
      revealed miR-199a to be significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer. 
      Bioinformatics and luciferase analyses showed that miR-199a negatively but directly 
      regulates FOXA2 expression through binding in its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). 
      Evaluation of the functional importance of miR-199a on pancreatic cancer revealed 
      that miR-199a acts as an inhibitor of FOXA2 expression, inducing an increase in 
      pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, gene 
      ontology and network analyses in PANC-1 cells treated with a small interfering RNA 
      (siRNA) against FOXA2 revealed an enrichment for cell invasion mechanisms through 
      PLAUR and ERK activation. FOXA2 deletion (FOXA2Δ) by using two CRISPR/Cas9 vectors 
      in PANC-1 cells induced tumor growth in vivo resulting in upregulation of PLAUR and 
      ERK pathways in FOXA2Δ xenograft tumors. We have identified FOXA2 as a novel tumor 
      suppressor in pancreatic cancer and it is regulated directly by miR-199a, thereby 
      enhancing our understanding of how microRNAs interplay with the transcription 
      factors to affect pancreatic oncogenesis.

AB  - Mouse transgenesis has provided fundamental insights into pancreatic cancer, but is 
      limited by the long duration of allele/model generation. Here we show 
      transfection-based multiplexed delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 to the pancreas of adult 
      mice, allowing simultaneous editing of multiple gene sets in individual cells. We 
      use the method to induce pancreatic cancer and exploit CRISPR/Cas9 mutational 
      signatures for phylogenetic tracking of metastatic disease. Our results demonstrate 
      that CRISPR/Cas9-multiplexing enables key applications, such as combinatorial 
      gene-network analysis, in vivo synthetic lethality screening and chromosome 
      engineering. Negative-selection screening in the pancreas using 
      multiplexed-CRISPR/Cas9 confirms the vulnerability of pancreatic cells to 
      Brca2-inactivation in a Kras-mutant context. We also demonstrate modelling of 
      chromosomal deletions and targeted somatic engineering of inter-chromosomal 
      translocations, offering multifaceted opportunities to study complex structural 
      variation, a hallmark of pancreatic cancer. The low-frequency mosaic pattern of 
      transfection-based CRISPR/Cas9 delivery faithfully recapitulates the stochastic 
      nature of human tumorigenesis, supporting wide applicability for 
      biological/preclinical research.

AB  - Most classic genetic approaches utilize binary modifications that preclude the 
      identification of key knockdowns for essential genes or other targets that only 
      require moderate modulation. As a complementary approach to these classic genetic 
      methods, we describe a plasmid-based library methodology that affords bidirectional, 
      graded modulation of gene expression enabled by tiling the promoter regions of all 
      969 genes that comprise the ito977 model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae's metabolic 
      network. When coupled with a CRISPR-dCas9-based modulation and next-generation 
      sequencing, this method affords a library-based, bidirection titration of gene 
      expression across all major metabolic genes. We utilized this approach in two case 
      studies: growth enrichment on alternative sugars, glycerol and galactose, and 
      chemical overproduction of betaxanthins, leading to the identification of unique 
      gene targets. In particular, we identify essential genes and other targets that were 
      missed by classic genetic approaches.

PG  - 1231-1242

AB  - Rett syndrome is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder which affects almost 
      exclusively girls, caused by variants in MECP2 gene. Effective therapies for this 
      devastating disorder are not yet available and the need for tight regulation of 
      MECP2 expression for brain to properly function makes gene replacement therapy 
      risky. For this reason, gene editing with CRISPR/Cas9 technology appears as a 
      preferable option for the development of new therapies. To study the disease, we 
      developed and characterized a human neuronal model obtained by genetic reprogramming 
      of patient-derived primary fibroblasts into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells. This 
      cellular model represents an important source for our studies, aiming to correct 
      MECP2 variants in neurons which represent the primarily affected cell type. We 
      engineered a gene editing toolkit composed by a two-plasmid system to correct a 
      hotspot missense variant in MECP2, c.473 C > T (p.(Thr158Met)). The first construct 
      expresses the variant-specific sgRNA and the Donor DNA along with a fluorescent 
      reporter system. The second construct brings Cas9 and targets for auto-cleaving, to 
      avoid long-term Cas9 expression. NGS analysis on sorted cells from four independent 
      patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing efficiency, with up to 80% of 
      HDR and less than 1% of indels in all patients, outlining the relevant potentiality 
      of the approach for Rett syndrome therapy.

AB  - In most human cancers, only a few genes are mutated at high frequencies; most are 
      mutated at low frequencies. The functional consequences of these recurrent but 
      infrequent "long tail" mutations are often unknown. We focused on 484 long tail 
      genes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and used in vivo CRISPR to 
      screen for genes that, upon mutation, trigger tumor development in mice. Of the 15 
      tumor-suppressor genes identified, ADAM10 and AJUBA suppressed HNSCC in a 
      haploinsufficient manner by promoting NOTCH receptor signaling. ADAM10 and AJUBA 
      mutations or monoallelic loss occur in 28% of human HNSCC cases and are mutually 
      exclusive with NOTCH receptor mutations. Our results show that oncogenic mutations 
      in 67% of human HNSCC cases converge onto the NOTCH signaling pathway, making NOTCH 
      inactivation a hallmark of HNSCC.

AB  - Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), genome editing 
      technologies and 3D organoid model systems highlight opportunities to develop new in 
      vitro human disease models to serve drug discovery programs. An ideal disease model 
      would accurately recapitulate the relevant disease phenotype and provide a scalable 
      platform for drug and genetic screening studies. Kidney organoids offer a high 
      cellular complexity that may provide greater insights than conventional single-cell 
      type cell culture models. However, genetic manipulation of the kidney organoids 
      requires prior generation of genetically modified clonal lines, which is a time and 
      labor consuming procedure. Here, we present a methodology for direct differentiation 
      of the CRISPR-targeted cell pools, using a doxycycline-inducible Cas9 expressing 
      hiPSC line for high efficiency editing to eliminate the laborious clonal line 
      generation steps. We demonstrate the versatile use of genetically engineered kidney 
      organoids by targeting the autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 
      genes: PKD1 and PKD2. Direct differentiation of the respective knockout pool 
      populations into kidney organoids resulted in the formation of cyst-like structures 
      in the tubular compartment. Our findings demonstrated that we can achieve > 80% 
      editing efficiency in the iPSC pool population which resulted in a reliable 3D 
      organoid model of ADPKD. The described methodology may provide a platform for rapid 
      target validation in the context of disease modeling.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201703103 [doi]
AB  - Activated danger or pathogen sensors trigger assembly of the inflammasome adaptor 
      ASC into specks, large signaling platforms considered hallmarks of inflammasome 
      activation. Because a lack of in vivo tools has prevented the study of endogenous 
      ASC dynamics, we generated a live ASC reporter through CRISPR/Cas9 tagging of the 
      endogenous gene in zebrafish. We see strong ASC expression in the skin and other 
      epithelia that act as barriers to insult. A toxic stimulus triggered speck formation 
      and rapid pyroptosis in keratinocytes in vivo. Macrophages engulfed and digested 
      that speck-containing, pyroptotic debris. A three-dimensional, ultrastructural 
      reconstruction, based on correlative light and electron microscopy of the in vivo 
      assembled specks revealed a compact network of highly intercrossed filaments, 
      whereas pyrin domain (PYD) or caspase activation and recruitment domain alone formed 
      filamentous aggregates. The effector caspase is recruited through PYD, whose 
      overexpression induced pyroptosis but only after substantial delay. Therefore, 
      formation of a single, compact speck and rapid cell-death induction in vivo requires 
      a full-length ASC.

LID - 10.1038/s41591-020-0840-5 [doi]
AB  - Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 editing of 
      immune checkpoint genes could improve the efficacy of T cell therapy, but the first 
      necessary undertaking is to understand the safety and feasibility. Here, we report 
      results from a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of CRISPR-Cas9 PD-1-edited T 
      cells in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      NCT02793856). Primary endpoints were safety and feasibility, and the secondary 
      endpoint was efficacy. The exploratory objectives included tracking of edited T 
      cells. All prespecified endpoints were met. PD-1-edited T cells were manufactured ex 
      vivo by cotransfection using electroporation of Cas9 and single guide RNA plasmids. 
      A total of 22 patients were enrolled; 17 had sufficient edited T cells for infusion, 
      and 12 were able to receive treatment. All treatment-related adverse events were 
      grade 1/2. Edited T cells were detectable in peripheral blood after infusion. The 
      median progression-free survival was 7.7 weeks (95% confidence interval, 6.9 to 
      8.5 weeks) and median overall survival was 42.6 weeks (95% confidence interval, 
      10.3-74.9 weeks). The median mutation frequency of off-target events was 0.05% 
      (range, 0-0.25%) at 18 candidate sites by next generation sequencing. We conclude 
      that clinical application of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited T cells is generally safe and 
      feasible. Future trials should use superior gene editing approaches to improve 
      therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Functional CRISPR and shRNA Screens Identify Involvement of Mitochondrial Electron 
      Transport in the Activation of Evofosfamide.
PG  - 638-651
LID - 10.1124/mol.118.115196 [doi]
AB  - Evofosfamide (TH-302) is a hypoxia-activated DNA-crosslinking prodrug currently in 
      clinical development for cancer therapy. Oxygen-sensitive activation of evofosfamide 
      depends on one-electron reduction, yet the reductases that catalyze this process in 
      tumors are unknown. We used RNA sequencing, whole-genome CRISPR knockout, and 
      reductase-focused short hairpin RNA screens to interrogate modifiers of evofosfamide 
      activation in cancer cell lines. Involvement of mitochondrial electron transport in 
      the activation of evofosfamide and the related nitroaromatic compounds EF5 and 
      FSL-61 was investigated using 143B ρ (0) (ρ zero) cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA 
      and biochemical assays in UT-SCC-74B cells. The potency of evofosfamide in 30 
      genetically diverse cancer cell lines correlated with the expression of genes 
      involved in mitochondrial electron transfer. A whole-genome CRISPR screen in KBM-7 
      cells identified the DNA damage-response factors SLX4IP, C10orf90 (FATS), and 
      SLFN11, in addition to the key regulator of mitochondrial function, YME1L1, and 
      several complex I constituents as modifiers of evofosfamide sensitivity. A 
      reductase-focused shRNA screen in UT-SCC-74B cells similarly identified 
      mitochondrial respiratory chain factors. Surprisingly, 143B ρ (0) cells showed 
      enhanced evofosfamide activation and sensitivity but had global transcriptional 
      changes, including increased expression of nonmitochondrial flavoreductases. In 
      UT-SCC-74B cells, evofosfamide oxidized cytochromes a, b, and c and inhibited 
      respiration at complexes I, II, and IV without quenching reactive oxygen species 
      production. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial electron transport chain 
      contributes to evofosfamide activation and that predicting evofosfamide sensitivity 
      in patients by measuring the expression of canonical bioreductive enzymes such as 
      cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase is likely to be futile.

AB  - Essential gene functions underpin the core reactions required for cell viability, 
      but their contributions and relationships are poorly studied in vivo. Using CRISPR 
      interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and 
      probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established 
      using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related 
      processes and identified modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. 
      Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions significantly reduced 
      stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that 
      essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. 
      Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively 
      insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, 
      revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape. Our results provide a 
      framework for systematic investigation of essential gene functions in vivo broadly 
      applicable to diverse microorganisms and amenable to comparative analysis.

TI  - Combined genome editing and transcriptional repression for metabolic pathway 
      engineering in Corynebacterium glutamicum using a catalytically active Cas12a.
PG  - 8911-8922
LID - 10.1007/s00253-019-10118-4 [doi]
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum is a versatile workhorse for producing industrially 
      important commodities. The design of an optimal strain often requires the 
      manipulation of metabolic and regulatory genes to different levels, such as 
      overexpression, downregulation, and deletion. Unfortunately, few tools to achieve 
      multiple functions simultaneously have been reported. Here, a dual-functional 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) (RE-CRISPR) 
      system that combined genome editing and transcriptional repression was designed 
      using a catalytically active Cas12a (a.k.a. Cpf1) in C. glutamicum. Firstly, gene 
      deletion was achieved using Cas12a under a constitutive promoter. Then, via 
      engineering of the guide RNA sequences, transcriptional repression was successfully 
      achieved using a catalytically active Cas12a with crRNAs containing 15 or 16 bp 
      spacer sequences, whose gene repression efficiency was comparable to that of the 
      canonical system (deactivated Cas12a with full-length crRNAs). Finally, RE-CRISPR 
      was developed to achieve genome editing and transcriptional repression 
      simultaneously by transforming a single crRNA plasmid and Cas12a plasmid. The 
      application of RE-CRISPR was demonstrated to increase the production of cysteine and 
      serine for ~ 3.7-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, in a single step. This study 
      expands the application of CRISPR/Cas12a-based genome engineering and provides a 
      powerful synthetic biology tool for multiplex metabolic engineering of C. 
      glutamicum.

AB  - Regulation of cytokine production in stimulated T cells can be disrupted in 
      autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies, and cancer. Systematic discovery of 
      stimulation-dependent cytokine regulators requires both loss-of-function and 
      gain-of-function studies, which have been challenging in primary human cells. We now 
      report genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) screens in 
      primary human T cells to identify gene networks controlling interleukin-2 (IL-2) and 
      interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. Arrayed CRISPRa confirmed key hits and enabled 
      multiplexed secretome characterization, revealing reshaped cytokine responses. 
      Coupling CRISPRa screening with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled deep molecular 
      characterization of screen hits, revealing how perturbations tuned T cell activation 
      and promoted cell states characterized by distinct cytokine expression profiles. 
      These screens reveal genes that reprogram critical immune cell functions, which 
      could inform the design of immunotherapies.

AB  - The rapid development of gene therapy and genome editing techniques brings up an 
      urgent need to develop safe and efficient nanoplatforms for nucleic acids and CRISPR 
      genome editors. Herein we report a stimulus-responsive silica nanoparticle (SNP) 
      capable of encapsulating biomacromolecules in their active forms with a high loading 
      content and loading efficiency as well as a well-controlled nanoparticle size 
      (~50 nm). A disulfide crosslinker was integrated into the silica network, endowing 
      SNP with glutathione (GSH)-responsive cargo release capability when internalized by 
      target cells. An imidazole-containing component was incorporated into the SNP to 
      enhance the endosomal escape capability. The SNP can deliver various cargos, 
      including nucleic acids (e.g., DNA and mRNA) and CRISPR genome editors (e.g., 
      Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP), and RNP with donor DNA) with excellent 
      efficiency and biocompatibility. The SNP surface can be PEGylated and functionalized 
      with different targeting ligands. In vivo studies showed that subretinally injected 
      SNP conjugated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and intravenously injected SNP 
      conjugated with GalNAc can effectively deliver mRNA and RNP to murine retinal 
      pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and liver cells, respectively, leading to efficient 
      genome editing. Overall, the SNP is a promising nanoplatform for various 
      applications including gene therapy and genome editing.

TI  - N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Hypofunction in Meg-01 Cells Reveals a Role for 
      Intracellular Calcium Homeostasis in Balancing Megakaryocytic-Erythroid 
      Differentiation.
PG  - 671-686
LID - 10.1055/s-0040-1708483 [doi]
AB  - The release of calcium ions (Ca(2+)) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and related 
      store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) regulate maturation of normal megakaryocytes. 
      The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) provides an additional mechanism 
      for Ca(2+) influx in megakaryocytic cells, but its role remains unclear. We created 
      a model of NMDAR hypofunction in Meg-01 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of 
      the GRIN1 gene, which encodes an obligate, GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR. We found that 
      compared with unmodified Meg-01 cells, Meg-01-GRIN1 (-/-) cells underwent atypical 
      differentiation biased toward erythropoiesis, associated with increased basal ER 
      stress and cell death. Resting cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels were higher in Meg-01-GRIN1 
      (-/-) cells, but ER Ca(2+) release and SOCE were lower after activation. 
      Lysosome-related organelles accumulated including immature dense granules that may 
      have contributed an alternative source of intracellular Ca(2+). Microarray analysis 
      revealed that Meg-01-GRIN1 (-/-) cells had deregulated expression of transcripts 
      involved in Ca(2+) metabolism, together with a shift in the pattern of hematopoietic 
      transcription factors toward erythropoiesis. In keeping with the observed pro-cell 
      death phenotype induced by GRIN1 deletion, memantine (NMDAR inhibitor) increased 
      cytotoxic effects of cytarabine in unmodified Meg-01 cells. In conclusion, NMDARs 
      comprise an integral component of the Ca(2+) regulatory network in Meg-01 cells that 
      help balance ER stress and megakaryocytic-erythroid differentiation. We also provide 
      the first evidence that megakaryocytic NMDARs regulate biogenesis of 
      lysosome-related organelles, including dense granules. Our results argue that 
      intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis may be more important for normal megakaryocytic and 
      erythroid differentiation than currently recognized; thus, modulation may offer 
      therapeutic opportunities.

AB  - Patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) show aberrant wiring of neuronal 
      connections formed during development which may contribute to symptoms of TSC, such 
      as intellectual disabilities, autism, and epilepsy. Yet models examining the 
      molecular basis for axonal guidance defects in developing human neurons have not 
      been developed. Here, we generate human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines 
      from a patient with TSC and genetically engineer counterparts and isogenic controls. 
      By differentiating hiPSCs, we show that control neurons respond to canonical 
      guidance cues as predicted. Conversely, neurons with heterozygous loss of TSC2 
      exhibit reduced responses to several repulsive cues and defective axon guidance. 
      While TSC2 is a known key negative regulator of MTOR-dependent protein synthesis, we 
      find that TSC2 signaled through MTOR-independent RHOA in growth cones. Our results 
      suggest that neural network connectivity defects in patients with TSC may result 
      from defects in RHOA-mediated regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics during neuronal 
      development.

TI  - Double Selection Enhances the Efficiency of Target-AID and Cas9-Based Genome Editing 
      in Yeast.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 loss of function (LOF) and base editing screens are powerful tools in 
      genetics and genomics. Yeast is one of the main models in these fields, but has only 
      recently started to adopt this new toolkit for high throughput experiments. We 
      developed a double selection strategy based on co-selection that increases LOF 
      mutation rates using the Target-AID base editor. We constructed the pDYSCKO vector, 
      which is amenable to high throughput double selection experiments, and show that the 
      improvement in Target-AID efficiency generalizes across loci. Using modeling, we 
      show that this improvement in efficiency provides the required increased in 
      detection power to measure the fitness effects of thousands of mutations in typical 
      yeast pooled screens. We show that double selection can also improve Cas9 mediated 
      LOF rates, but that this multiplex genome editing causes programmable chromosomal 
      translocations at high frequency. This suggests that multiplex LOF editing should be 
      performed with caution and that base-editors could be preferable tools for some 
      screens in yeast. Base editing using double selection is simple and straightforward 
      and provides an alternative to homology directed repair based high throughput 
      variant strain construction methods.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in HTT. Here we report correction of HD human induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (hiPSCs) using a CRISPR-Cas9 and piggyBac transposon-based approach. We 
      show that both HD and corrected isogenic hiPSCs can be differentiated into 
      excitable, synaptically active forebrain neurons. We further demonstrate that 
      phenotypic abnormalities in HD hiPSC-derived neural cells, including impaired neural 
      rosette formation, increased susceptibility to growth factor withdrawal, and 
      deficits in mitochondrial respiration, are rescued in isogenic controls. 
      Importantly, using genome-wide expression analysis, we show that a number of 
      apparent gene expression differences detected between HD and non-related healthy 
      control lines are absent between HD and corrected lines, suggesting that these 
      differences are likely related to genetic background rather than HD-specific 
      effects. Our study demonstrates correction of HD hiPSCs and associated phenotypic 
      abnormalities, and the importance of isogenic controls for disease modeling using 
      hiPSCs.

AB  - During mitosis, the macromolecular kinetochore complex assembles on the centromere 
      to orchestrate chromosome segregation. The properties and architecture of the 
      16-subunit Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) that allow it to build 
      a robust platform for kinetochore assembly are poorly understood. Here, we use 
      inducible CRISPR knockouts and biochemical reconstitutions to define the 
      interactions between the human CCAN proteins. We find that the CCAN does not 
      assemble as a linear hierarchy, and instead, each sub-complex requires multiple 
      non-redundant interactions for its localization to centromeres and the structural 
      integrity of the overall assembly. We demonstrate that the CENP-L-N complex plays a 
      crucial role at the core of this assembly through interactions with CENP-C and 
      CENP-H-I-K-M. Finally, we show that the CCAN is remodeled over the cell cycle such 
      that sub-complexes depend on their interactions differentially. Thus, an 
      interdependent meshwork within the CCAN underlies the centromere specificity and 
      stability of the kinetochore.

TI  - Soluble St2 Induces Cardiac Fibroblast Activation and Collagen Synthesis via 
      Neuropilin-1.
LID - 10.3390/cells9071667 [doi]
LID - 1667
AB  - Circulating levels of soluble interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (sST2) are increased in 
      heart failure and associated with poor outcome, likely because of the activation of 
      inflammation and fibrosis. We investigated the pathogenic role of sST2 as an 
      inductor of cardiac fibroblasts activation and collagen synthesis. The effects of 
      sST2 on human cardiac fibroblasts was assessed using proteomics and immunodetection 
      approaches to evidence the upregulation of neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), a regulator of the 
      profibrotic transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. In parallel, sST2 increased 
      fibroblast activation, collagen and fibrosis mediators. Pharmacological inhibition 
      of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) restored NRP-1 levels and blocked profibrotic 
      effects induced by sST2. In NRP-1 knockdown cells, sST2 failed to induce fibroblast 
      activation and collagen synthesis. Exogenous NRP-1 enhanced cardiac fibroblast 
      activation and collagen synthesis via NF-κB. In a pressure overload rat model, sST2 
      was elevated in association with cardiac fibrosis and was positively correlated with 
      NRP-1 expression. Our study shows that sST2 induces human cardiac fibroblasts 
      activation, as well as the synthesis of collagen and profibrotic molecules. These 
      effects are mediated by NRP-1. The blockade of NF-κB restored NRP-1 expression, 
      improving the profibrotic status induced by sST2. These results show a new 
      pathogenic role for sST2 and its mediator, NRP-1, as cardiac fibroblast activators 
      contributing to cardiac fibrosis.

AB  - How genome-wide association studies-identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) affect remote genes remains unknown. Expression quantitative trait locus 
      (eQTL) association meta-analysis on 496 prostate tumor and 602 normal prostate 
      samples with 117 SNPs revealed novel cis-eQTLs and trans-eQTLs. Mediation testing 
      and colocalization analysis demonstrate that MSMB is a cis-acting mediator for 
      SNHG11 (P < 0.01). Removing rs10993994 in LNCaP cell lines by CRISPR/Cas9 editing 
      shows that the C-allele corresponds with an over 100-fold increase in MSMB 
      expression and 5-fold increase in SNHG11 compared with the T-allele. Colocalization 
      analysis confirmed that the same set of SNPs associated with MSMB expression is 
      associated with SNHG11 expression (posterior probability of shared variants is 66.6% 
      in tumor and 91.4% in benign). These analyses further demonstrate variants driving 
      MSMB expression differ in tumor and normal, suggesting regulatory network rewiring 
      during tumorigenesis.

AB  - Resolving functions of closely linked genes is challenging or nearly impossible with 
      classical genetic tools. Four members of the Catharanthus roseus receptor-like 
      kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) family are clustered on Arabidopsis chromosome five. To 
      resolve the potentially redundant functions of this subclass of CrRLK1Ls named 
      MEDOS1 to 4 (MDS1 to 4), we generated a single CRISPR/Cas9 transformation vector 
      using a Golden Gate based cloning system to target all four genes simultaneously. We 
      introduce single mutations within and deletions between MDS genes as well as 
      knock-outs of the whole 11 kb gene cluster. The large MDS cluster deletion was 
      inherited in up to 25% of plants lacking the CRISPR/Cas9 construct in the T2 
      generation. In contrast to described phenotypes of already characterized CrRLK1L 
      mutants, quadruple mds knock-outs were fully fertile, developed normal root hairs 
      and trichomes and responded to pharmacological inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis 
      similar to wildtype. Recently, we demonstrated the role of four CrRLK1L in growth 
      adaptation to metal ion stress. Here we show the involvement of MDS genes in 
      response to Ni(2+) during hypocotyl elongation and to Cd(2+) and Zn(2+) during root 
      growth. Our finding supports the model of an organ specific network of positively 
      and negatively acting CrRLK1Ls.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Telomere Removal Leads to Mitochondrial Stress and Protein 
      Aggregation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18102093 [doi]
LID - 2093
AB  - Aging is considered the major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Telomere shortening is associated with cellular 
      senescence. In this regard, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of telomerase 
      activity has been used to model cellular aging. Here, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 
      technology to instantly remove the telomere to induce aging in a neuroblastoma cell 
      line. Expression of both Cas9 and guide RNA targeting telomere repeats ablated the 
      telomere, leading to retardation of cell proliferation. Instant deletion of telomere 
      in SH-SY5Y cells impaired mitochondrial function with diminished mitochondrial 
      respiration and cell viability. Supporting the pathological relevance of cell aging 
      by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated telomere removal, alterations were observed in the levels of 
      PD-associated proteins including PTEN-induced putative kinase 1, peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α, nuclear respiratory factor 1, 
      parkin, and aminoacyl tRNA synthetase complex interacting multifunctional protein 2. 
      Significantly, α-synuclein expression in the background of telomere removal led to 
      the enhancement of protein aggregation, suggesting positive feed-forward interaction 
      between aging and PD pathogenesis. Collectively, our results demonstrate that 
      CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to efficiently model cellular aging and PD.

TI  - Is amplification bias consequential in transposon sequencing (TnSeq) assays? A case 
      study with a Staphylococcus aureus TnSeq library subjected to PCR-based and 
      amplification-free enrichment methods.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000655 [doi]
LID - 000655
AB  - As transposon sequencing (TnSeq) assays have become prolific in the microbiology 
      field, it is of interest to scrutinize their potential drawbacks. TnSeq data consist 
      of millions of nucleotide sequence reads that are generated by PCR amplification of 
      transposon-genomic junctions. Reads mapping to the junctions are enumerated thus 
      providing information on the number of transposon insertion mutations in each 
      individual gene. Here we explore the possibility that PCR amplification of 
      transposon insertions in a TnSeq library skews the results by introducing bias into 
      the detection and/or enumeration of insertions. We compared the detection and 
      frequency of mapped insertions when altering the number of PCR cycles, and when 
      including a nested PCR, in the enrichment step. Additionally, we present nCATRAs - a 
      novel, amplification-free TnSeq method where the insertions are enriched via 
      CRISPR/Cas9-targeted transposon cleavage and subsequent Oxford Nanopore MinION 
      sequencing. nCATRAs achieved 54 and 23% enrichment of the transposons and 
      transposon-genomic junctions, respectively, over background genomic DNA. These 
      PCR-based and PCR-free experiments demonstrate that, overall, PCR amplification does 
      not significantly bias the results of TnSeq insofar as insertions in the majority of 
      genes represented in our library were similarly detected regardless of PCR cycle 
      number and whether or not PCR amplification was employed. However, the detection of 
      a small subset of genes which had been previously described as essential is 
      sensitive to the number of PCR cycles. We conclude that PCR-based enrichment of 
      transposon insertions in a TnSeq assay is reliable, but researchers interested in 
      profiling putative essential genes should carefully weigh the number of 
      amplification cycles employed in their library preparation protocols. In addition, 
      nCATRAs is comparable to traditional PCR-based methods (Kendall's 
      correlation=0.896-0.897) although the latter remain superior owing to their 
      accessibility and high sequencing depth.

AB  - Aim: To develop a novel nanovector for the delivery of genetic fragments and 
      CRISPR/Cas9 systems in particular. Materials & methods: Vitamin D(3)-functionalized 
      carbon dots (D/CDs) fabricated using one-step microwave-aided methods were 
      characterized by different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The 
      3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and flow 
      cytometry were employed to determine the cell viability and transfection efficiency. 
      Results: D/CDs transfected CRISPR plasmid in various cell lines with high efficiency 
      while maintaining their remarkable efficacy at high serum concentration and low 
      plasmid doses. They also showed great potential for the green fluorescent protein 
      disruption by delivering two different types of CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Conclusion: 
      Given their high efficiency and safety, D/CDs provide a versatile gene-delivery 
      vector for clinical applications.

TI  - Role of AmpG in the resistance to β-lactam agents, including cephalosporins and 
      carbapenems: candidate for a novel antimicrobial target.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s12941-021-00446-7 [doi]
LID - 45
AB  - BACKGROUND: A complex cascade of genes, enzymes, and transcription factors regulates 
      AmpC β-lactamase overexpression. We investigated the network of AmpC β-lactamase 
      overexpression in Klebsiella aerogenes and identified the role of AmpG in resistance 
      to β-lactam agents, including cephalosporins and carbapenems. METHODS: A transposon 
      mutant library was created for carbapenem-resistant K. aerogenes YMC2008-M09-943034 
      (KE-Y1) to screen for candidates with increased susceptibility to carbapenems, which 
      identified the susceptible mutant derivatives KE-Y3 and KE-Y6. All the strains were 
      subjected to highly contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing to 
      investigate the loss of resistance due to transposon insertion. Complementation and 
      knock-out experiments using lambda Red-mediated homologous recombinase and 
      CRISPR-Cas9 were performed to confirm the role of gene of interest. RESULTS: 
      In-depth analysis of KE-Y3 and KE-Y6 revealed the insertion of a transposon at six 
      positions in each strain, at which truncation of the AmpG permease gene was common 
      in both. The disruption of the AmpG permease leads to carbapenem susceptibility, 
      which was further confirmed by complementation. We generated an AmpG permease gene 
      knockout using lambda Red-mediated recombineering in K. aerogenes KE-Y1 and a 
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout in multidrug-resistant Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae-YMC/2013/D to confer carbapenem susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings suggest that inhibition of the AmpG is a potential strategy to increase the 
      efficacy of β-lactam agents against Klebsiella aerogenes.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has revolutionized functional genomics in vertebrates. 
      However, CRISPR/Cas9 edited F(0) animals too often demonstrate variable phenotypic 
      penetrance due to the mosaic nature of editing outcomes after double strand break 
      (DSB) repair. Even with high efficiency levels of genome editing, phenotypes may be 
      obscured by proportional presence of in-frame mutations that still produce 
      functional protein. Recently, studies in cell culture systems have shown that the 
      nature of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations can be dependent on local sequence context 
      and can be predicted by computational methods. Here, we demonstrate that similar 
      approaches can be used to forecast CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in Xenopus 
      tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, and zebrafish. We show that a publicly available neural 
      network previously trained in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures (InDelphi-mESC) is 
      able to accurately predict CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing outcomes in early vertebrate 
      embryos. Our observations can have direct implications for experiment design, 
      allowing the selection of guide RNAs with predicted repair outcome signatures 
      enriched towards frameshift mutations, allowing maximization of CRISPR/Cas9 
      phenotype penetrance in the F(0) generation.

TI  - Artificial selection on storage protein 1 possibly contributes to increase of 
      hatchability during silkworm domestication.
PG  - e1007616

AB  - Like other domesticates, the efficient utilization of nitrogen resources is also 
      important for the only fully domesticated insect, the silkworm. Deciphering the way 
      in which artificial selection acts on the silkworm genome to improve the utilization 
      of nitrogen resources and to advance human-favored domestication traits, will 
      provide clues from a unique insect model for understanding the general rules of 
      Darwin's evolutionary theory on domestication. Storage proteins (SPs), which belong 
      to a hemocyanin superfamily, basically serve as a source of amino acids and nitrogen 
      during metamorphosis and reproduction in insects. In this study, through blast 
      searching on the silkworm genome and further screening of the artificial selection 
      signature on silkworm SPs, we discovered a candidate domestication gene, i.e., the 
      methionine-rich storage protein 1 (SP1), which is clearly divergent from other 
      storage proteins and exhibits increased expression in the ova of domestic silkworms. 
      Knockout of SP1 via the CRISPR/Cas9 technique resulted in a dramatic decrease in egg 
      hatchability, without obvious impact on egg production, which was similar to the 
      effect in the wild silkworm compared with the domestic type. Larval development and 
      metamorphosis were not affected by SP1 knockout. Comprehensive ova comparative 
      transcriptomes indicated significant higher expression of genes encoding 
      vitellogenin, chorions, and structural components in the extracellular matrix 
      (ECM)-interaction pathway, enzymes in folate biosynthesis, and notably hormone 
      synthesis in the domestic silkworm, compared to both the SP1 mutant and the wild 
      silkworm. Moreover, compared with the wild silkworms, the domestic one also showed 
      generally up-regulated expression of genes enriched in the structural constituent of 
      ribosome and amide, as well as peptide biosynthesis. This study exemplified a novel 
      case in which artificial selection could act directly on nitrogen resource proteins, 
      further affecting egg nutrients and eggshell formation possibly through a hormone 
      signaling mediated regulatory network and the activation of ribosomes, resulting in 
      improved biosynthesis and increased hatchability during domestication. These 
      findings shed new light on both the understanding of artificial selection and 
      silkworm breeding from the perspective of nitrogen and amino acid resources.

TI  - Aldosterone Impairs Mitochondrial Function in Human Cardiac Fibroblasts via A-Kinase 
      Anchor Protein 12.
PG  - 6801

AB  - Aldosterone (Aldo) contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac oxidative 
      stress. Using a proteomic approach, A-kinase anchor protein (AKAP)-12 has been 
      identified as a down-regulated protein by Aldo in human cardiac fibroblasts. We aim 
      to characterize whether AKAP-12 down-regulation could be a deleterious mechanism 
      which induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in cardiac cells. Aldo 
      down-regulated AKAP-12 via its mineralocorticoid receptor, increased oxidative 
      stress and induced mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased 
      mitochondrial-DNA and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 
      1-alpha (PGC-1α) expressions in human cardiac fibroblasts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
      knock-down of AKAP-12 produced similar deleterious effects in human cardiac 
      fibroblasts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated activation of AKAP-12 blunted Aldo effects on 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in human cardiac fibroblasts. In 
      Aldo-salt-treated rats, cardiac AKAP-12, mitochondrial-DNA and PGC-1α expressions 
      were decreased and paralleled increased oxidative stress. In myocardial biopsies 
      from patients with aortic stenosis (AS, n = 26), AKAP-12, mitochondrial-DNA and 
      PGC-1α expressions were decreased as compared to Controls (n = 13). Circulating Aldo 
      levels inversely correlated with cardiac AKAP-12. PGC-1α positively associated with 
      AKAP-12 and with mitochondrial-DNA. Aldo decreased AKAP-12 expression, impairing 
      mitochondrial biogenesis and increasing cardiac oxidative stress. AKAP-12 
      down-regulation triggered by Aldo may represent an important event in the 
      development of mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac oxidative stress.

AB  - Genome editing in human cells with targeted nucleases now enables diverse 
      experimental and therapeutic genome engineering applications, but extension to 
      primary human B cells remains limited. Here we report a method for targeted genetic 
      engineering in primary human B cells, utilizing electroporation of CRISPR-Cas9 
      ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to introduce gene knockout mutations at protein-coding 
      loci with high efficiencies that in some cases exceeded 80%. Further, we demonstrate 
      knock-in editing of targeted nucleotides with efficiency exceeding 10% through 
      co-delivery of oligonucleotide templates for homology directed repair. We delivered 
      Cas9 RNPs in two distinct in vitro culture systems to achieve editing in both 
      undifferentiated B cells and activated B cells undergoing differentiation, 
      reflecting utility in diverse experimental conditions. In summary, we demonstrate a 
      powerful and scalable research tool for functional genetic studies of human B cell 
      biology that may have further applications in engineered B cell therapeutics.

TI  - Intronic SMCHD1 variants in FSHD: testing the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 genome 
      editing.
PG  - 828-837
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is associated with partial 
      chromatin relaxation of the DUX4 retrogene containing D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on 
      chromosome 4, and transcriptional de-repression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle. The 
      common form of FSHD, FSHD1, is caused by a D4Z4 repeat array contraction. The less 
      common form, FSHD2, is generally caused by heterozygous variants in SMCHD1. METHODS: 
      We employed whole exome sequencing combined with Sanger sequencing to screen 
      uncharacterised FSHD2 patients for extra-exonic SMCHD1 mutations. We also used 
      CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to repair a pathogenic intronic SMCHD1 variant from 
      patient myoblasts. RESULTS: We identified intronic SMCHD1 variants in two FSHD 
      families. In the first family, an intronic variant resulted in partial intron 
      retention and inclusion of the distal 14 nucleotides of intron 13 into the 
      transcript. In the second family, a deep intronic variant in intron 34 resulted in 
      exonisation of 53 nucleotides of intron 34. In both families, the aberrant 
      transcripts are predicted to be non-functional. Deleting the pseudo-exon by 
      CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing in primary and immortalised myoblasts from the 
      index case of the second family restored wild-type SMCHD1 expression to a level that 
      resulted in efficient suppression of DUX4. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated intronic 
      mutation frequency of almost 2% in FSHD2, as exemplified by the two novel intronic 
      SMCHD1 variants identified here, emphasises the importance of screening for intronic 
      variants in SMCHD1. Furthermore, the efficient suppression of DUX4 after restoring 
      SMCHD1 levels by genome editing of the mutant allele provides further guidance for 
      therapeutic strategies.

AB  - RNA regulatory elements (RREs) are an important yet relatively under-explored facet 
      of gene regulation. Deciphering the prevalence and functional impact of this 
      post-transcriptional control layer requires technologies for disrupting RREs without 
      perturbing cellular homeostasis. Here we describe genome-engineering based 
      evaluation of RNA regulatory element activity (GenERA), a clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 platform for in situ 
      high-content functional analysis of RREs. We use GenERA to survey the entire 
      regulatory landscape of a 3'UTR, and apply it in a multiplex fashion to analyse 
      combinatorial interactions between sets of miRNA response elements (MREs), providing 
      strong evidence for cooperative activity. We also employ this technology to probe 
      the functionality of an entire MRE network under cellular homeostasis, and show that 
      high-resolution analysis of the GenERA dataset can be used to extract functional 
      features of MREs. This study provides a genome editing-based multiplex strategy for 
      direct functional interrogation of RNA cis-regulatory elements in a native cellular 
      environment.

AB  - The lack of mechanistic explanations for many genotype-phenotype associations 
      identified by GWAS precludes thorough assessment of their impact on human health. 
      Here, we conducted an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping analysis in 
      erythroblasts and found erythroid-specific eQTLs for ATP2B4, the main calcium ATPase 
      of red blood cells (rbc). The same SNPs were previously associated with mean 
      corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and susceptibility to severe malaria 
      infection. We showed that Atp2b4-/- mice demonstrate increased MCHC, confirming 
      ATP2B4 as the causal gene at this GWAS locus. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we fine mapped the 
      genetic signal to an erythroid-specific enhancer of ATP2B4. Erythroid cells with a 
      deletion of the ATP2B4 enhancer had abnormally high intracellular calcium levels. 
      These results illustrate the power of combined transcriptomic, epigenomic, and 
      genome-editing approaches in characterizing noncoding regulatory elements in 
      phenotype-relevant cells. Our study supports ATP2B4 as a potential target for 
      modulating rbc hydration in erythroid disorders and malaria infection.

AB  - Functional genomics studies in minimal mycoplasma cells enable unobstructed access 
      to some of the most fundamental processes in biology. Conventional transposon 
      bombardment and gene knockout approaches often fail to reveal functions of genes 
      that are essential for viability, where lethality precludes phenotypic 
      characterization. Conditional inactivation of genes is effective for characterizing 
      functions central to cell growth and division, but tools are limited for this 
      purpose in mycoplasmas. Here we demonstrate systems for inducible repression of gene 
      expression based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats-mediated interference (CRISPRi) in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and synthetic 
      Mycoplasma mycoides, two organisms with reduced genomes actively used in systems 
      biology studies. In the synthetic cell, we also demonstrate inducible gene 
      expression for the first time. Time-course data suggest rapid kinetics and 
      reversible engagement of CRISPRi. Targeting of six selected endogenous genes with 
      this system results in lowered transcript levels or reduced growth rates that agree 
      with lack or shortage of data in previous transposon bombardment studies, and now 
      produces actual cells to analyze. The ksgA gene encodes a methylase that modifies 
      16S rRNA, rendering it vulnerable to inhibition by the antibiotic kasugamycin. 
      Targeting the ksgA gene with CRISPRi removes the lethal effect of kasugamycin and 
      enables cell growth, thereby establishing specific and effective gene modulation 
      with our system. The facile methods for conditional gene activation and inactivation 
      in mycoplasmas open the door to systematic dissection of genetic programs at the 
      core of cellular life.

TI  - A Genome-scale CRISPR Screen Identifies the ERBB and mTOR Signaling Networks as Key 
      Determinants of Response to PI3K Inhibition in Pancreatic Cancer.
PG  - 1423-1435
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-1131 [doi]
AB  - KRAS mutation is a key driver of pancreatic cancer and PI3K pathway activity is an 
      additional requirement for Kras-induced tumorigenesis. Clinical trials of PI3K 
      pathway inhibitors in pancreatic cancer have shown limited responses. Understanding 
      the molecular basis for this lack of efficacy may direct future treatment strategies 
      with emerging PI3K inhibitors. We sought new therapeutic approaches that synergize 
      with PI3K inhibitors through pooled CRISPR modifier genetic screening and a drug 
      combination screen. ERBB family receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and mTOR 
      signaling were key modifiers of sensitivity to alpelisib and pictilisib. Inhibition 
      of the ERBB family or mTOR was synergistic with PI3K inhibition in spheroid, stromal 
      cocultures. Near-complete loss of ribosomal S6 phosphorylation was associated with 
      synergy. Genetic alterations in the ERBB-PI3K signaling axis were associated with 
      decreased survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. Suppression of the PI3K/mTOR 
      axis is potentiated by dual PI3K and ERBB family or mTOR inhibition. Surprisingly, 
      despite the presence of oncogenic KRAS, thought to bestow independence from receptor 
      tyrosine kinase signaling, inhibition of the ERBB family blocks downstream pathway 
      activation and synergizes with PI3K inhibitors. Further exploration of these 
      therapeutic combinations is warranted for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

LID - S0085-2538(20)30554-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.kint.2020.04.049 [doi]
AB  - Primary hyperoxaluria type I is caused by mutations in the alanine glyoxylate 
      aminotransferase gene (AGXT), leading to accumulation of glyoxylate and subsequent 
      production of oxalate and urolithiasis. Here, we generated a novel rat model of 
      primary hyperoxaluria type I that carries a D205N mutation in the partially 
      humanized Agxt gene through the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The AgxtD205N mutant rats showed 
      undetectable alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase protein expression, developed 
      hyperoxaluria at 1 month of age and exhibited severe renal calcium oxalate 
      deposition after ethylene glycol challenge. This suggests our novel model is more 
      relevant to the human disease than existing animal models. To test whether this 
      model could be used for the development of innovative therapeutics, SaCas9 targeting 
      hydroxyacid oxidase 1, responsible for metabolizing glycolate into glyoxylate, was 
      delivered via adeno-associated viral vectors into newborn rats with primary 
      hyperoxaluria type 1. This approach generated nearly 30% indels in the Hao1 gene in 
      the liver, leading to 42% lower urine oxalate levels in the treated group than in 
      the control group and preventing the rats with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 from 
      undergoing severe nephrocalcinosis for at least 12 months. Thus, our results 
      demonstrate that this partially humanized AgxtD205N rat strain is a high-performing 
      model of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 for understanding pathology, and the 
      development of novel therapeutics, such as reprogramming of the metabolic pathway 
      through genome editing.

TI  - Human BCL-G regulates secretion of inflammatory chemokines but is dispensable for 
      induction of apoptosis by IFN-γ and TNF-α in intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 68

LID - 68
AB  - Proteins of the BCL-2 family are evolutionarily conserved modulators of apoptosis 
      that function as sensors of cellular integrity. Over the past three decades multiple 
      BCL-2 family members have been identified, many of which are now fully incorporated 
      into regulatory networks governing the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. For some, 
      however, an exact role in cell death signalling remains unclear. One such 'orphan' 
      BCL-2 family member is BCL-G (or BCL2L14). In this study we analysed 
      gastrointestinal expression of human BCL-G in health and disease states, and 
      investigated its contribution to inflammation-induced tissue damage by exposing 
      intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) to IFN-γ and TNF-α, two pro-inflammatory mediators 
      associated with gut immunopathology. We found that both BCL-G splice variants - 
      BCL-G(S) (short) and BCL-G(L) (long) - were highly expressed in healthy gut tissue, 
      and that their mRNA levels decreased in active inflammatory bowel diseases (for 
      BCL-G(S)) and colorectal cancer (for BCL-G(S/L)). In vitro studies revealed that 
      IFN-γ and TNF-α synergised to upregulate BCL-G(S/L) and to trigger apoptosis in 
      colonic epithelial cell lines and primary human colonic organoids. Using RNAi, we 
      showed that synergistic induction of IEC death was STAT1-dependent while optimal 
      expression of BCL-G(S/L) required STAT1, NF-κB/p65 and SWI/SNF-associated chromatin 
      remodellers BRM and BRG1. To test the direct contribution of BCL-G to the effects of 
      IFN-γ and TNF-α on epithelial cells, we used RNAi- and CRISPR/Cas9-based 
      perturbations in parallel with isoform-specific overexpression of BCL-G, and found 
      that BCL-G was dispensable for Th1 cytokine-induced apoptosis of human IEC. Instead, 
      we discovered that depletion of BCL-G differentially affected secretion of 
      inflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CCL20, thus uncovering a non-apoptotic 
      immunoregulatory function of this BCL-2 family member. Taken together, our data 
      indicate that BCL-G may be involved in shaping immune responses in the human gut in 
      health and disease states through regulation of chemokine secretion rather than 
      intestinal apoptosis.

AB  - Despite its eponymous association with the heat shock response, yeast heat shock 
      factor 1 (Hsf1) is essential even at low temperatures. Here we show that engineered 
      nuclear export of Hsf1 results in cytotoxicity associated with massive protein 
      aggregation. Genome-wide analysis revealed that Hsf1 nuclear export immediately 
      decreased basal transcription and mRNA expression of 18 genes, which predominately 
      encode chaperones. Strikingly, rescuing basal expression of Hsp70 and Hsp90 
      chaperones enabled robust cell growth in the complete absence of Hsf1. With the 
      exception of chaperone gene induction, the vast majority of the heat shock response 
      was Hsf1 independent. By comparative analysis of mammalian cell lines, we found that 
      only heat shock-induced but not basal expression of chaperones is dependent on the 
      mammalian Hsf1 homolog (HSF1). Our work reveals that yeast chaperone gene expression 
      is an essential housekeeping mechanism and provides a roadmap for defining the 
      function of HSF1 as a driver of oncogenesis.

TI  - Depletion of microbiome-derived molecules in the host using Clostridium genetics.

LID - eaav1282
AB  - The gut microbiota produce hundreds of molecules that are present at high 
      concentrations in the host circulation. Unraveling the contribution of each molecule 
      to host biology remains difficult. We developed a system for constructing clean 
      deletions in Clostridium spp., the source of many molecules from the gut microbiome. 
      By applying this method to the model commensal organism Clostridium sporogenes, we 
      knocked out genes for 10 C. sporogenes-derived molecules that accumulate in host 
      tissues. In mice colonized by a C. sporogenes for which the production of branched 
      short-chain fatty acids was knocked out, we discovered that these microbial products 
      have immunoglobulin A-modulatory activity.

TI  - Enabling genetic analysis of diverse bacteria with Mobile-CRISPRi.
PG  - 244-250

AB  - The vast majority of bacteria, including human pathogens and microbiome species, 
      lack genetic tools needed to systematically associate genes with phenotypes. This is 
      the major impediment to understanding the fundamental contributions of genes and 
      gene networks to bacterial physiology and human health. Clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi), a versatile method of 
      blocking gene expression using a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) and 
      programmable single guide RNAs, has emerged as a powerful genetic tool to dissect 
      the functions of essential and non-essential genes in species ranging from bacteria 
      to humans(1-6). However, the difficulty of establishing effective CRISPRi systems 
      across bacteria is a major barrier to its widespread use to dissect bacterial gene 
      function. Here, we establish 'Mobile-CRISPRi', a suite of CRISPRi systems that 
      combines modularity, stable genomic integration and ease of transfer to diverse 
      bacteria by conjugation. Focusing predominantly on human pathogens associated with 
      antibiotic resistance, we demonstrate the efficacy of Mobile-CRISPRi in 
      gammaproteobacteria and Bacillales Firmicutes at the individual gene scale, by 
      examining drug-gene synergies, and at the library scale, by systematically 
      phenotyping conditionally essential genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. 
      Mobile-CRISPRi enables genetic dissection of non-model bacteria, facilitating 
      analyses of microbiome function, antibiotic resistances and sensitivities, and 
      comprehensive screens for host-microorganism interactions.

TI  - N(6)-methyladenosine mRNA marking promotes selective translation of regulons 
      required for human erythropoiesis.
PG  - 4596

LID - 4596
AB  - Many of the regulatory features governing erythrocyte specification, maturation, and 
      associated disorders remain enigmatic. To identify new regulators of erythropoiesis, 
      we utilize a functional genomic screen for genes affecting expression of the 
      erythroid marker CD235a/GYPA. Among validating hits are genes coding for the 
      N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) mRNA methyltransferase (MTase) complex, including, 
      METTL14, METTL3, and WTAP. We demonstrate that m(6)A MTase activity promotes 
      erythroid gene expression programs through selective translation of ~300 m(6)A 
      marked mRNAs, including those coding for SETD histone methyltransferases, ribosomal 
      components, and polyA RNA binding proteins. Remarkably, loss of m(6)A marks results 
      in dramatic loss of H3K4me3 marks across key erythroid-specific KLF1 transcriptional 
      targets (e.g., Heme biosynthesis genes). Further, each m(6)A MTase subunit and a 
      subset of their mRNAs targets are required for human erythroid specification in 
      primary bone-marrow derived progenitors. Thus, m(6)A mRNA marks promote the 
      translation of a network of genes required for human erythropoiesis.

TI  - In vivo CRISPR screening unveils histone demethylase UTX as an important epigenetic

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Inactivation of 
      tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) promotes lung cancer malignant progression. Here, we 
      take advantage of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
      (CRISPR)/Cas9-mediated somatic gene knockout in a Kras(G12D/+) mouse model to 
      identify bona fide TSGs. From individual knockout of 55 potential TSGs, we identify 
      five genes, including Utx, Ptip, Acp5, Acacb, and Clu, whose knockout significantly 
      promotes lung tumorigenesis. These candidate genes are frequently down-regulated in 
      human lung cancer specimens and significantly associated with survival in patients 
      with lung cancer. Through crossing the conditional Utx knockout allele to the 
      Kras(G12D/+) mouse model, we further find that Utx deletion dramatically promotes 
      lung cancer progression. The tumor-promotive effect of Utx knockout in vivo is 
      mainly mediated through an increase of the EZH2 level, which up-regulates the 
      H3K27me3 level. Moreover, the Utx-knockout lung tumors are preferentially sensitive 
      to EZH2 inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our study provides a systematic screening 
      of TSGs in vivo and identifies UTX as an important epigenetic regulator in lung 
      tumorigenesis.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor progression, recurrence, and drug 
      resistance. To identify genetic vulnerabilities of colon cancer, we performed 
      targeted CRISPR dropout screens comprising 657 Drugbank targets and 317 epigenetic 
      regulators on two patient-derived colon CSC-enriched spheroids. Next-generation 
      sequencing of pooled genomic DNAs isolated from surviving cells yielded therapeutic 
      candidates. We unraveled 44 essential genes for colon CSC-enriched spheroids 
      propagation, including key cholesterol biosynthetic genes (HMGCR, FDPS, and GGPS1). 
      Cholesterol biosynthesis was induced in colon cancer tissues, especially 
      CSC-enriched spheroids. The genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HMGCR/FDPS 
      impaired self-renewal capacity and tumorigenic potential of the spheroid models in 
      vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HMGCR or FDPS depletion impaired cancer stemness 
      characteristics by activating TGF-β signaling, which in turn downregulated 
      expression of inhibitors of differentiation (ID) proteins, key regulators of cancer 
      stemness. Cholesterol and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) rescued the growth 
      inhibitory and signaling effect of HMGCR/FDPS blockade, implying a direct role of 
      these metabolites in modulating stemness. Finally, cholesterol biosynthesis 
      inhibitors and 5-FU demonstrated antitumor synergy in colon CSC-enriched spheroids, 
      tumor organoids, and xenografts. Taken together, our study unravels novel genetic 
      vulnerabilities of colon CSC-enriched spheroids and suggests cholesterol 
      biosynthesis as a potential target in conjunction with traditional chemotherapy for 
      colon cancer treatment.

AB  - Safe and efficient delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 systems is still a challenge. Here we 
      report the development of fluorescent nitrogen- and zinc-doped carbon dots 
      (N-Zn-doped CDs) using one-step microwave-aided pyrolysis based on citric acid, 
      branched PEI(25k), and different zinc salts. These versatile nanovectors with a 
      quantum yield of around 60% could not only transfect large CRISPR plasmids (∼9 kb) 
      with higher efficiency (80%) compared to PEI(25k) and lipofectamine 2000 (Lipo 2K), 
      but they also delivered mRNA into HEK 293T cells with the efficiency 20 times 
      greater than and equal to that of PEI(25k) and Lipo 2K, respectively. Unlike 
      PEI(25k), N-Zn-doped CDs exhibited good transfection efficiency even at low plasmid 
      doses and in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Moreover, these 
      nanovectors demonstrated excellent efficiency in GFP gene disruption by transferring 
      plasmid encoding Cas9 and sgRNA targeting GFP as well as Cas9/sgRNA 
      ribonucleoproteins into HEK 293T-GFP cells. Hence, N-Zn-doped CDs with remarkable 
      photoluminescence properties and high transfection efficiency in the delivery of 
      both CRISPR complexes and mRNA provide a promising platform for developing safe, 
      efficient, and traceable delivery systems for biological research.

AB  - Simultaneous dysregulation of multiple microRNAs (miRs) affects various pathological 
      pathways related to cardiac failure. In addition to being potential cardiac 
      disease-specific markers, miR-23b/27b/24-1 were reported to be responsible for 
      conferring cardiac pathophysiological processes. In this study, we identified a 
      conserved guanine-rich RNA motif within the miR-23b/27b/24-1 cluster that can form 
      an RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) in vitro and in cells. Disruption of this intragenic rG4 
      significantly increased the production of all three miRs. Conversely, a G4-binding 
      ligand tetrandrine (TET) stabilized the rG4 and suppressed miRs production in human 
      and rodent cardiomyocytes. Our further study showed that the rG4 prevented 
      Drosha-DGCR8 binding and processing of the pri-miR, suppressing the biogenesis of 
      all three miRs. Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated G4 deletion in the rat genome 
      aberrantly elevated all three miRs in the heart in vivo, leading to cardiac 
      contractile dysfunction. Importantly, loss of the G4 resulted in reduced targets for 
      the aforementioned miRs critical for normal heart function and defects in the L-type 
      Ca2+ channel-ryanodine receptor (LCC-RyR) coupling in cardiomyocytes. Our results 
      reveal a novel mechanism for G4-dependent regulation of miR biogenesis, which is 
      essential for maintaining normal heart function.

TI  - Precise Editing of the OsPYL9 Gene by RNA-Guided Cas9 Nuclease Confers Enhanced 
      Drought Tolerance and Grain Yield in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by Regulating Circadian 
      Rhythm and Abiotic Stress Responsive Proteins.
LID - 10.3390/ijms21217854 [doi]
LID - 7854
AB  - Abscisic acid (ABA) is involved in regulating drought tolerance, and pyrabactin 
      resistance-like (PYL) proteins are known as ABA receptors. To elucidate the role of 
      one of the ABA receptors in rice, OsPYL9 was mutagenized through CRISPR/Cas9 in 
      rice. Homozygous and heterozygous mutant plants lacking any off-targets and T-DNA 
      were screened based on site-specific sequencing and used for morpho-physiological, 
      molecular, and proteomic analysis. Mutant lines appear to accumulate higher ABA, 
      antioxidant activities, chlorophyll content, leaf cuticular wax, and survival rate, 
      whereas a lower malondialdehyde level, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and 
      vascular bundles occur under stress conditions. Proteomic analysis found a total of 
      324 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), out of which 184 and 140 were up and 
      downregulated, respectively. The OsPYL9 mutants showed an increase in grain yield 
      under both drought and well watered field conditions. Most of the DEPs related to 
      circadian clock rhythm, drought response, and reactive oxygen species were 
      upregulated in the mutant plants. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      analysis revealed that DEPs were only involved in circadian rhythm and Gene Ontology 
      (GO) analysis showed that most of the DEPs were involved in response to abiotic 
      stimulus, and abscisic acid-activated signaling pathways. Protein GIGANTEA, 
      Adagio-like, and Pseudo-response regulator proteins showed higher interaction in 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Thus, the overall results showed that 
      CRISPR/Cas9-generated OsPYL9 mutants have potential to improve both drought 
      tolerance and the yield of rice. Furthermore, global proteome analysis provides new 
      potential biomarkers and understandings of the molecular mechanism of rice drought 
      tolerance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus infection is the main cause 
      of various types of cancer especially cervical cancer. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of 
      HPV play critical roles in promoting carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth. As a 
      result, E6 and E7 oncogenes are considered as promising therapeutic targets for 
      cervical cancer. Recently, the development of genome-editing technologies including 
      transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN), meganucleases (MNs), zinc 
      finger nucleases (ZFN), and more importantly clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat-CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) has sparked a revolution 
      in the cervical cancer-targeted therapy. However, due to immunogenicity, off-target 
      effect, renal clearance, guide RNA (gRNA) nuclease degradation, and difficult direct 
      transportation into the cytoplasm and nucleus, the safe and effective delivery is 
      considered as the Achilles' heel of this robust strategy. AREAS COVERED: In this 
      review, we discuss cutting-edge available strategies for in vivo delivery of 
      genome-editing technologies for HPV-induced cervical cancer therapy. Moreover, the 
      combination of genome-editing tools and other therapies has been fully discussed. 
      EXPERT OPINION: The combination of nanoparticle-based delivery systems and 
      genome-editing tools is a promising powerful strategy for cervical cancer therapy. 
      The most significant limitations of this strategy that need to be focused on are low 
      efficiency and off-target events.

TI  - Transcriptional and Functional Analysis of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 
      Exposure to Tetracycline.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01999-18 [doi]
LID - e01999-18
AB  - Commercial probiotic bacteria must be tested for acquired antibiotic resistance 
      elements to avoid potential transfer to pathogens. The European Food Safety 
      Authority recommends testing resistance using microdilution culture techniques 
      previously used to establish inhibitory thresholds for the Bifidobacterium genus. 
      Many Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strains exhibit increased resistance to 
      tetracycline, historically attributed to the ribosomal protection gene tet(W). 
      However, some strains that harbor genetically identical tet(W) genes show various 
      inhibition levels, suggesting that other genetic elements also contribute to 
      observed differences. Here, we adapted several molecular assays to confirm the 
      inhibition of B. animalis subsp. lactis strains Bl-04 and HN019 and employed RNA 
      sequencing to assess the transcriptional differences related to genomic 
      polymorphisms. We detected specific stress responses to the antibiotic by 
      correlating ATP concentration to number of viable genome copies from droplet digital 
      PCR and found that the bacteria were still metabolically active in high drug 
      concentrations. Transcriptional analyses revealed that several polymorphic regions, 
      particularly a novel multidrug efflux transporter, were differentially expressed 
      between the strains in each experimental condition, likely having phenotypic 
      effects. We also found that the tet(W) gene was upregulated only during 
      subinhibitory tetracycline concentrations, while two novel tetracycline resistance 
      genes were upregulated at high concentrations. Furthermore, many genes involved in 
      amino acid metabolism and transporter function were upregulated, while genes for 
      complex carbohydrate utilization, protein metabolism, and clustered regularly 
      interspaced short palindromic repeat(s) (CRISPR)-Cas systems were downregulated. 
      These results provide high-throughput means for assessing antibiotic resistances of 
      two highly related probiotic strains and determine the genetic network that 
      contributes to the global tetracycline response.IMPORTANCE Bifidobacterium animalis 
      subsp. lactis is widely used in human food and dietary supplements. Although well 
      documented to be safe, B. animalis subsp. lactis strains must not contain 
      transferable antibiotic resistance elements. Many B. animalis subsp. lactis strains 
      have different resistance measurements despite being genetically similar, and the 
      reasons for this are not well understood. In the current study, we sought to examine 
      how genomic differences between two closely related industrial B. animalis subsp. 
      lactis strains contribute to different resistance levels. This will lead to a better 
      understanding of resistance, identify future targets for analysis of 
      transferability, and expand our understanding of tetracycline resistance in 
      bacteria.

TI  - Programmed Editing of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) OsSPL16 Gene Using CRISPR/Cas9 Improves 
      Grain Yield by Modulating the Expression of Pyruvate Enzymes and Cell Cycle 
      Proteins.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22010249 [doi]

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the major crops in the world and significant 
      increase in grain yield is constant demand for breeders to meet the needs of a 
      rapidly growing population. The size of grains is one of major components 
      determining rice yield and a vital trait for domestication and breeding. To increase 
      the grain size in rice, OsSPL16/qGW8 was mutagenized through CRISPR/Cas9, and 
      proteomic analysis was performed to reveal variations triggered by mutations. More 
      specifically, mutants were generated with two separate guide RNAs targeting 
      recognition sites on opposite strands and genomic insertions and deletions were 
      characterized. Mutations followed Mendelian inheritance and homozygous and 
      heterozygous mutants lacking any T-DNA and off-target effects were screened. The 
      mutant lines showed a significant increase in grain yield without any change in 
      other agronomic traits in T(0), T(1), and T(2) generations. Proteomic screening 
      found a total of 44 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), out of which 33 and 11 
      were up and downregulated, respectively. Most of the DEPs related to pyruvate 
      kinase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and cell division and proliferation were upregulated 
      in the mutant plants. Pathway analysis revealed that DEPs were enriched in the 
      biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, pyruvate metabolism, 
      glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, carbon metabolism, ubiquinone and other 
      terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis, and citrate cycle. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis 
      presented that most of the DEPs were involved in the pyruvate metabolic process and 
      pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Proteins related to pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 
      component subunit alpha-1 displayed higher interaction in the protein-protein 
      interaction (PPI) network. Thus, the overall results revealed that 
      CRISPR/Cas9-guided OsSPL16 mutations have the potential to boost the grain yield of 
      rice. Additionally, global proteome analysis has broad applications for discovering 
      molecular components and dynamic regulation underlying the targeted gene mutations.

AB  - Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) including lenalidomide and pomalidomide bind cereblon 
      (CRBN) and activate the CRL4(CRBN) ubiquitin ligase to trigger proteasomal 
      degradation of the essential transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 and multiple 
      myeloma (MM) cytotoxicity. We have shown that CRBN is also targeted for degradation 
      by SCF(Fbxo7) ubiquitin ligase. In the current study, we explored the mechanisms 
      underlying sensitivity of MM cells to IMiDs using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening. 
      We validate that CSN9 signalosome complex, a deactivator of Cullin-RING ubiquitin 
      ligase, inhibits SCF(Fbxo7) E3 ligase-mediated CRBN degradation, thereby conferring 
      sensitivity to IMiDs; conversely, loss of function of CSN9 signalosome activates 
      SCF(Fbxo7) complex, thereby enhancing degradation of CRBN and conferring IMiD 
      resistance. Finally, we show that pretreatment with either proteasome inhibitors or 
      NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitors can abrogate degradation and maintain 
      levels of CRBN, thereby enhancing sensitivity to IMiDs. These studies therefore 
      demonstrate that CSN9 signalosome complex regulates sensitivity to IMiDs by 
      modulating CRBN expression.

TI  - Identification of Cellular Factors Required for SARS-CoV-2 Replication.
LID - 10.3390/cells10113159 [doi]
LID - 3159
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the recently emerged 
      virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical presentation can range from 
      asymptomatic disease and mild respiratory tract infection to severe disease with 
      lung injury, multiorgan failure, and death. SARS-CoV-2 is the third animal 
      coronavirus to emerge in humans in the 21st century, and coronaviruses appear to 
      possess a unique ability to cross borders between species and infect a wide range of 
      organisms. This is somewhat surprising as, except for the requirement of host cell 
      receptors, cell-pathogen interactions are usually species-specific. Insights into 
      these host-virus interactions will provide a deeper understanding of the process of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a means for the design and development of antiviral 
      agents. In this study, we describe a complex analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection using 
      a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out system in HeLa cells overexpressing entry 
      receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This platform allows for the 
      identification of factors required for viral replication. This study was designed to 
      include a high number of replicates (48 replicates; 16 biological repeats with 3 
      technical replicates each) to prevent data instability, remove sources of bias, and 
      allow multifactorial bioinformatic analyses in order to study the resulting 
      interaction network. The results obtained provide an interesting insight into the 
      replication mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Abrogating GPT2 in triple-negative breast cancer inhibits tumor growth and promotes 
      autophagy.
PG  - 1993-2009
LID - 10.1002/ijc.33456 [doi]
AB  - Uncontrolled proliferation and altered metabolic reprogramming are hallmarks of 
      cancer. Active glycolysis and glutaminolysis are characteristic features of these 
      hallmarks and required for tumorigenesis. A fine balance between cancer metabolism 
      and autophagy is a prerequisite of homeostasis within cancer cells. Here we show 
      that glutamate pyruvate transaminase 2 (GPT2), which serves as a pivot between 
      glycolysis and glutaminolysis, is highly upregulated in aggressive breast cancers, 
      particularly the triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Abrogation of this enzyme 
      results in decreased tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, which promotes the 
      rewiring of glucose carbon atoms and alterations in nutrient levels. Concordantly, 
      loss of GPT2 results in an impairment of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 
      activity as well as the induction of autophagy. Furthermore, in vivo xenograft 
      studies have shown that autophagy induction correlates with decreased tumor growth 
      and that markers of induced autophagy correlate with low GPT2 levels in patient 
      samples. Taken together, these findings indicate that cancer cells have a close 
      network between metabolic and nutrient sensing pathways necessary to sustain 
      tumorigenesis and that aminotransferase reactions play an important role in 
      maintaining this balance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of nuclear mitochondrial DNA (numtDNA) has been reported 
      within several nuclear genomes. Next to mitochondrial protein-coding genes, numtDNA 
      sequences also encode for mitochondrial tRNA genes. However, the biological roles of 
      numtDNA remain elusive. RESULTS: Employing in silico analysis, we identify 281 
      mitochondrial tRNA homologs in the human genome, which we term nimtRNAs (nuclear 
      intronic mitochondrial-derived tRNAs), being contained within introns of 76 nuclear 
      host genes. Despite base changes in nimtRNAs when compared to their mtRNA homologs, 
      a canonical tRNA cloverleaf structure is maintained. To address potential functions 
      of intronic nimtRNAs, we insert them into introns of constitutive and alternative 
      splicing reporters and demonstrate that nimtRNAs promote pre-mRNA splicing, 
      dependent on the number and positioning of nimtRNA genes and splice site recognition 
      efficiency. A mutational analysis reveals that the nimtRNA cloverleaf structure is 
      required for the observed splicing increase. Utilizing a CRISPR/Cas9 approach, we 
      show that a partial deletion of a single endogenous nimtRNA(Lys) within intron 28 of 
      the PPFIBP1 gene decreases inclusion of the downstream-located exon 29 of the 
      PPFIBP1 mRNA. By employing a pull-down approach followed by mass spectrometry, a 
      3'-splice site-associated protein network is identified, including KHDRBS1, which we 
      show directly interacts with nimtRNA(Tyr) by an electrophoretic mobility shift 
      assay. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that nimtRNAs, along with associated protein factors, 
      can act as a novel class of intronic splicing regulatory elements in the human 
      genome by participating in the regulation of splicing.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of leghemoglobin genes in Lotus japonicus uncovers their 
      synergistic roles in symbiotic nitrogen fixation.
PG  - 818-832
LID - 10.1111/nph.16077 [doi]
AB  - Legume nodules contain high concentrations of leghemoglobins (Lbs) encoded by 
      several genes. The reason for this multiplicity is unknown. CRISPR/Cas9 technology 
      was used to generate stable mutants of the three Lbs of Lotus japonicus. The 
      phenotypes were characterized at the physiological, biochemical and molecular 
      levels. Nodules of the triple mutants were examined by electron microscopy and 
      subjected to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Complementation studies revealed 
      that Lbs function synergistically to maintain optimal N(2) fixation. The nodules of 
      the triple mutants overproduced superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide, which was 
      probably linked to activation of NADPH oxidases and changes in superoxide dismutase 
      isoforms expression. The mutant nodules showed major ultrastructural alterations, 
      including vacuolization, accumulation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and disruption of 
      mitochondria. RNA-seq of c. 20 000 genes revealed significant changes in expression 
      of carbon and nitrogen metabolism genes, transcription factors, and proteinases. 
      Lb-deficient nodules had c. 30-50-fold less heme but similar transcript levels of 
      heme biosynthetic genes, suggesting a post-translational regulatory mechanism of 
      heme synthesis. We conclude that Lbs act additively in nodules and that the lack of 
      Lbs results in early nodule senescence. Our observations also provide insight into 
      the reprogramming of the gene expression network associated with Lb deficiency, 
      probably as a result of uncontrolled intracellular free O(2) concentration.

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the brain ventricles is critical for brain 
      development. Altered CSF flow dynamics have been implicated in congenital 
      hydrocephalus (CH) characterized by the potentially lethal expansion of cerebral 
      ventricles if not treated. CH is the most common neurosurgical indication in 
      children effecting 1 per 1000 infants. Current treatment modalities are limited to 
      antiquated brain surgery techniques, mostly because of our poor understanding of the 
      CH pathophysiology. We lack model systems where the interplay between ependymal 
      cilia, embryonic CSF flow dynamics and brain development can be analyzed in depth. 
      This is in part due to the poor accessibility of the vertebrate ventricular system 
      to in vivo investigation. Here, we show that the genetically tractable frog Xenopus 
      tropicalis, paired with optical coherence tomography imaging, provides new insights 
      into CSF flow dynamics and role of ciliary dysfunction in hydrocephalus 
      pathogenesis. We can visualize CSF flow within the multi-chambered ventricular 
      system and detect multiple distinct polarized CSF flow fields. Using CRISPR/Cas9 
      gene editing, we modeled human L1CAM and CRB2 mediated aqueductal stenosis. We 
      propose that our high-throughput platform can prove invaluable for testing candidate 
      human CH genes to understand CH pathophysiology.

TI  - MOV10 Helicase Interacts with Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein and Has Antiviral 
      Activity.

AB  - Coronaviruses (CoVs) are emergent pathogens that may cause life-threatening 
      respiratory diseases in humans. Understanding of CoV-host interactions may help to 
      identify novel therapeutic targets. MOV10 is an RNA helicase involved in different 
      steps of cellular RNA metabolism. Both MOV10 antiviral and proviral activities have 
      been described in a limited number of viruses, but this protein has not been 
      previously associated with CoVs. We found that during Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, MOV10 aggregated in cytoplasmic 
      structures colocalizing with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. MOV10-N interaction was 
      confirmed by endogenous MOV10 coimmunoprecipitation, and the presence of other 
      cellular proteins was also detected in MOV10 complexes. MOV10 silencing 
      significantly increased both N protein accumulation and virus titer, with no changes 
      in the accumulation of viral RNAs. Moreover, MOV10 overexpression caused a 10-fold 
      decrease in viral titers. These data indicated that MOV10 has antiviral activity 
      during MERS-CoV infection. We postulated that this activity could be mediated by 
      viral RNA sequestration, and in fact, RNA immunoprecipitation data showed the 
      presence of viral RNAs in the MOV10 cytoplasmic complexes. Expression of wild-type 
      MOV10 or of a MOV10 mutant without helicase activity in MOV10 knockout cell lines, 
      developed by CRISPR-Cas technology, indicated that the helicase activity of MOV10 
      was required for its antiviral effect. Interestingly MOV10-N interaction was 
      conserved in other mildly or highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the recently 
      emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), although MOV10 
      antiviral activity was found only in highly pathogenic CoVs, suggesting a potential 
      role of MOV10 in the modulation of human CoVs pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses 
      (CoVs) are emerging pathogens causing life-threatening diseases in humans. Knowledge 
      of virus-host interactions and viral subversion mechanisms of host pathways is 
      required for the development of effective countermeasures against CoVs. The 
      interaction between cellular RNA helicase MOV10 and nucleocapsid (N) protein from 
      several human CoVs is shown. Using MERS-CoV as a model, we demonstrate that MOV10 
      has antiviral function, requiring its helicase activity, most likely mediated by 
      viral RNA sequestration in cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures. Furthermore, we 
      found that MOV10 antiviral activity may act only in highly pathogenic human CoVs, 
      suggesting a role for MOV10 in modulating CoVs pathogenesis. The present study 
      uncovers a complex network of viral and cellular RNAs and proteins interaction 
      modulating the antiviral response against CoVs.

TI  - Analysing Parallel Strategies to Alter the Host Specificity of Bacteriophage T7.
LID - 10.3390/biology10060556 [doi]
LID - 556
AB  - The recognition and binding of host bacteria by bacteriophages is most often enabled 
      by a highly specific receptor-ligand type of interaction, with the receptor-binding 
      proteins (RBPs) of phages being the primary determinants of host specificity. 
      Specifically modifying the RBPs could alter or extend the host range of phages 
      otherwise exhibiting desired phenotypic properties. This study employed two 
      different strategies to reprogram T7 phages ordinarily infecting commensal K12 
      Escherichia coli strains to infect pathogen-associated K1-capsule-expressing 
      strains. The strategies were based on either plasmid-based homologous recombination 
      or bacteriophage recombineering using electroporated DNA (BRED). Our work pursued 
      the construction of two genetic designs: one replacing the gp17 gene of T7, the 
      other replacing gp11, gp12, and gp17 of T7 with their K1F counterparts. Both 
      strategies displayed successful integration of the K1F sequences into the T7 genome, 
      detected by PCR screening. Multiple methods were utilised to select or enrich for 
      chimeric phages incorporating the K1F gp17 alone, including trxA, host-specificity, 
      and CRISPR-Cas-based selection. Irrespective of the selection method, the above 
      strategy yielded poorly reproducible phage propagation on the new host, indicating 
      that the chimeric phage was less fit than the wild type and could not promote 
      continual autonomous reproduction. Chimeric phages obtained from BRED incorporating 
      gp11-12 and gp17, however, all displayed infection in a 2-stage pattern, indicating 
      the presence of both K1F and T7 phenotypes. This study shows that BRED can be used 
      as a tool to quickly access the potential of new RBP constructs without the need to 
      engineer sustainably replicating phages. Additionally, we show that solely 
      repurposing the primary RBP is, in some cases, insufficient to produce a viable 
      chimeric phage.

AB  - Pigs with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are an emerging biomedical animal 
      model. Swine are anatomically and physiologically more similar to humans than mice, 
      making them an invaluable tool for preclinical regenerative medicine and cancer 
      research. One essential step in further developing this model is the immunological 
      humanization of SCID pigs. In this work we have generated T(-) B(-) NK(-) SCID pigs 
      through site directed CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of IL2RG within a naturally occurring 
      DCLRE1C (ARTEMIS) (-/-) genetic background. We confirmed ART (-/-) IL2RG (-/Y) pigs 
      lacked T, B, and NK cells in both peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. 
      Additionally, we successfully performed a bone marrow transplant on one ART (-/-) 
      IL2RG (-/Y) male SCID pig with bone marrow from a complete swine leukocyte antigen 
      (SLA) matched donor without conditioning to reconstitute porcine T and NK cells. 
      Next, we performed in utero injections of cultured human CD34(+) selected cord blood 
      cells into the fetal ART (-/-) IL2RG (-/Y) SCID pigs. At birth, human CD45(+) 
      CD3ε(+) cells were detected in cord and peripheral blood of in utero injected SCID 
      piglets. Human leukocytes were also detected within the bone marrow, spleen, liver, 
      thymus, and mesenteric lymph nodes of these animals. Taken together, we describe 
      critical steps forwards the development of an immunologically humanized SCID pig 
      model.

TI  - Targeted genetic screening in mice through haploid embryonic stem cells identifies 
      critical genes in bone development.

AB  - Mutagenic screening is powerful for identifying key genes involved in developmental 
      processes. However, such screens are successful only in lower organisms. Here, we 
      develop a targeted genetic screening approach in mice through combining androgenetic 
      haploid embryonic stem cells (AG-haESCs) and clustered regularly interspaced 
      palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology. We 
      produced a mutant semi-cloned (SC) mice pool by oocyte injection of AG-haESCs 
      carrying constitutively expressed Cas9 and an single guide RNA (sgRNA) library 
      targeting 72 preselected genes in one step and screened for bone-development-related 
      genes through skeletal analysis at birth. This yielded 4 genes: Zic1 and Clec11a, 
      which are required for bone development, and Rln1 and Irx5, which had not been 
      previously considered. Whereas Rln1-/- mice exhibited small skeletal size only at 
      birth, Irx5-/- mice showed skeletal abnormalities both in postnatal and adult phases 
      due to decreased bone mass and increased bone marrow adipogenesis. Mechanistically, 
      iroquois homeobox 5 (IRX5) promotes osteoblastogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis by 
      suppressing peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation. Thus, 
      AG-haESC-mediated functional mutagenic screening opens new avenues for genetic 
      interrogation of developmental processes in mice.

TI  - Role for Galectin-3 in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.
LID - e004360
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease, and 
      calcification plays an important role in the progression of the disease. Galectin-3 
      (Gal-3) is a proinflammatory molecule involved in vascular osteogenesis in 
      atherosclerosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that Gal-3 could mediate valve 
      calcification in AS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Blood samples and aortic valves (AVs) from 
      77 patients undergoing AV replacement were analyzed. As controls, noncalcified human 
      AVs were obtained at autopsy (n=11). Gal-3 was spontaneously expressed in valvular 
      interstitial cells (VICs) from AVs and increased in AS as compared to control AVs. 
      Positive correlations were found between circulating and valvular Gal-3 levels. 
      Valvular Gal-3 colocalized with the VICs markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin and 
      vimentin, and with the osteogenic markers, osteopontin, bone morphogenetic protein 
      2, runt-related transcription factor 2, and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 9. 
      Gal-3 also colocalized with the inflammatory markers cd68, cd80 and tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha. In vitro, in VICs isolated from AVs, Gal-3 induced expression of 
      inflammatory, fibrotic, and osteogenic markers through the extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 pathway. Gal-3 expression was blocked in VICs 
      undergoing osteoblastic differentiation using its pharmacological inhibitor, 
      modified citrus pectin, or the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats/Cas9 knockout system. Gal-3 blockade and knockdown decreased the expression 
      of inflammatory, fibrotic, and osteogenic markers in differentiated VICs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Gal-3, which is overexpressed in AVs from AS patients, appears to play 
      a central role in calcification in AS. Gal-3 could be a new therapeutic approach to 
      delay the progression of AV calcification in AS.

AB  - Systematic mapping of genetic interactions (GIs) and interrogation of the functions 
      of sizable genomic segments in mammalian cells represent important goals of 
      biomedical research. To advance these goals, we present a CRISPR (clustered 
      regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based screening system for 
      combinatorial genetic manipulation that employs coexpression of CRISPR-associated 
      nucleases 9 and 12a (Cas9 and Cas12a) and machine-learning-optimized libraries of 
      hybrid Cas9-Cas12a guide RNAs. This system, named Cas Hybrid for Multiplexed Editing 
      and screening Applications (CHyMErA), outperforms genetic screens using Cas9 or 
      Cas12a editing alone. Application of CHyMErA to the ablation of mammalian paralog 
      gene pairs reveals extensive GIs and uncovers phenotypes normally masked by 
      functional redundancy. Application of CHyMErA in a chemogenetic interaction screen 
      identifies genes that impact cell growth in response to mTOR pathway inhibition. 
      Moreover, by systematically targeting thousands of alternative splicing events, 
      CHyMErA identifies exons underlying human cell line fitness. CHyMErA thus represents 
      an effective screening approach for GI mapping and the functional analysis of 
      sizable genomic regions, such as alternative exons.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis of GmLHY genes alters plant height and 
      internode length in soybean.
PG  - 562

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max) is an economically important oil and protein crop. 
      Plant height is a key trait that significantly impacts the yield of soybean; 
      however, research on the molecular mechanisms associated with soybean plant height 
      is lacking. The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeat)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated system 9) system is a recently developed technology 
      for gene editing that has been utilized to edit the genomes of crop plants. RESULTS: 
      Here, we designed four gRNAs to mutate four LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes in 
      soybean. In order to test whether the gRNAs could perform properly in transgenic 
      soybean plants, we first tested the CRISPR construct in transgenic soybean hairy 
      roots using Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain K599. Once confirmed, we performed 
      stable soybean transformation and obtained 19 independent transgenic soybean plants. 
      Subsequently, we obtained one T(1) transgene-free homozygous quadruple mutant of 
      GmLHY by self-crossing. The phenotypes of the T(2)-generation transgene-free 
      quadruple mutant plants were observed, and the results showed that the quadruple 
      mutant of GmLHY displayed reduced plant height and shortened internodes. The levels 
      of endogenous gibberellic acid (GA3) in Gmlhy1a1b2a2b was lower than in the wild 
      type (WT), and the shortened internode phenotype could be rescued by treatment with 
      exogenous GA3. In addition, the relative expression levels of GA metabolic pathway 
      genes in the quadruple mutant of GmLHY were significantly decreased in comparison to 
      the WT. These results suggest that GmLHY encodes an MYB transcription factor that 
      affects plant height through mediating the GA pathway in soybean. We also developed 
      genetic markers for identifying mutants for application in breeding studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted mutagenesis of 
      four GmLHY genes reduces soybean plant height and shortens internodes from 20 to 
      35 days after emergence (DAE). These findings provide insight into the mechanisms 
      underlying plant height regulatory networks in soybean.

AB  - Migratory cells use distinct motility modes to navigate different microenvironments, 
      but it is unclear whether these modes rely on the same core set of polarity 
      components. To investigate this, we disrupted actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) and 
      the WASP-family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE) complex, which assemble branched 
      actin networks that are essential for neutrophil polarity and motility in standard 
      adherent conditions. Surprisingly, confinement rescues polarity and movement of 
      neutrophils lacking these components, revealing a processive bleb-based protrusion 
      program that is mechanistically distinct from the branched actin-based protrusion 
      program but shares some of the same core components and underlying molecular logic. 
      We further find that the restriction of protrusion growth to one site does not 
      always respond to membrane tension directly, as previously thought, but may rely on 
      closely linked properties such as local membrane curvature. Our work reveals a 
      hidden circuit for neutrophil polarity and indicates that cells have distinct 
      molecular mechanisms for polarization that dominate in different microenvironments.

TI  - A quantitative image analysis pipeline for the characterization of filamentous 
      fungal morphologies as a tool to uncover targets for morphology engineering: a case 
      study using aplD in Aspergillus niger.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fungal fermentation is used to produce a diverse repertoire of enzymes, 
      chemicals, and drugs for various industries. During submerged cultivation, 
      filamentous fungi form a range of macromorphologies, including dispersed mycelia, 
      clumped aggregates, or pellets, which have critical implications for rheological 
      aspects during fermentation, gas/nutrient transfer, and, thus, product titres. An 
      important component of strain engineering efforts is the ability to quantitatively 
      assess fungal growth phenotypes, which will drive novel leads for morphologically 
      optimized production strains. RESULTS: In this study, we developed an automated 
      image analysis pipeline to quantify the morphology of pelleted and dispersed growth 
      (MPD) which rapidly and reproducibly measures dispersed and pelleted 
      macromorphologies from any submerged fungal culture. It (i) enables capture and 
      analysis of several hundred images per user/day, (ii) is designed to quantitatively 
      assess heterogeneous cultures consisting of dispersed and pelleted forms, (iii) 
      gives a quantitative measurement of culture heterogeneity, (iv) automatically 
      generates key Euclidian parameters for individual fungal structures including 
      particle diameter, aspect ratio, area, and solidity, which are also assembled into a 
      previously described dimensionless morphology number MN, (v) has an in-built quality 
      control check which enables end-users to easily confirm the accuracy of the 
      automated calls, and (vi) is easily adaptable to user-specified magnifications and 
      macromorphological definitions. To concomitantly provide proof of principle for the 
      utility of this image analysis pipeline, and provide new leads for morphologically 
      optimized fungal strains, we generated a morphological mutant in the cell factory 
      Aspergillus niger based on CRISPR-Cas technology. First, we interrogated a 
      previously published co-expression networks for A. niger to identify a putative 
      gamma-adaptin encoding gene (aplD) that was predicted to play a role in endosome 
      cargo trafficking. Gene editing was used to generate a conditional aplD expression 
      mutant under control of the titratable Tet-on system. Reduced aplD expression caused 
      a hyperbranched growth phenotype and diverse defects in pellet formation with a 
      putative increase in protein secretion. This possible protein hypersecretion 
      phenotype could be correlated with increased dispersed mycelia, and both decreased 
      pellet diameter and MN. CONCLUSION: The MPD image analysis pipeline is a simple, 
      rapid, and flexible approach to quantify diverse fungal morphologies. As an 
      exemplar, we have demonstrated that the putative endosomal transport gene aplD plays 
      a crucial role in A. niger filamentous growth and pellet formation during submerged 
      culture. This suggests that endocytic components are underexplored targets for 
      engineering fungal cell factories.

AB  - To build complex genetic networks with predictable behaviors, synthetic biologists 
      use libraries of modular parts that can be characterized in isolation and assembled 
      together to create programmable higher-order functions. Characterization experiments 
      and computational models for gene regulatory parts operating in isolation are 
      routinely used to predict the dynamics of interconnected parts and guide the 
      construction of new synthetic devices. Here, we individually characterize two modes 
      of RNA-based transcriptional regulation, using small transcription activating RNAs 
      (STARs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference 
      (CRISPRi), and show how their distinct regulatory timescales can be used to engineer 
      a composed feedforward loop that creates a pulse of gene expression. We use a 
      cell-free transcription-translation system (TXTL) to rapidly characterize the 
      system, and we apply Bayesian inference to extract kinetic parameters for an 
      ordinary differential equation-based mechanistic model. We then demonstrate in 
      simulation and verify with TXTL experiments that the simultaneous regulation of a 
      single gene target with STARs and CRISPRi leads to a pulse of gene expression. Our 
      results suggest the modularity of the two regulators in an integrated genetic 
      circuit, and we anticipate that construction and modeling frameworks that can 
      leverage this modularity will become increasingly important as synthetic circuits 
      increase in complexity.

AB  - Adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) trauma interrupts neural networks and, 
      because axonal regeneration is minimal, neurological deficits persist. Repair via 
      axonal growth is limited by extracellular inhibitors and cell-autonomous factors. 
      Based on results from a screen in vitro, we evaluate nearly 400 genes through a 
      large-scale in vivo regeneration screen. Suppression of 40 genes using viral-driven 
      short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) promotes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regeneration 
      after optic nerve crush (ONC), and most are validated by separate CRISPR-Cas9 
      editing experiments. Expression of these axon-regeneration-suppressing genes is not 
      significantly altered by axotomy. Among regeneration-limiting genes, loss of the 
      interleukin 22 (IL-22) cytokine allows an early, yet transient, inflammatory 
      response in the retina after injury. Reduced IL-22 drives concurrent activation of 
      signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and dual leucine zipper 
      kinase (DLK) pathways and upregulation of multiple neuron-intrinsic 
      regeneration-associated genes (RAGs). Including IL-22, our screen identifies dozens 
      of genes that limit CNS regeneration. Suppression of these genes in the context of 
      axonal damage could support improved neural repair.

AB  - Integrating single-cell trajectory analysis with pooled genetic screening could 
      reveal the genetic architecture that guides cellular decisions in development and 
      disease. We applied this paradigm to probe the genetic circuitry that controls 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We used single-cell RNA sequencing to 
      profile epithelial cells undergoing a spontaneous spatially determined EMT in the 
      presence or absence of transforming growth factor-β. Pseudospatial trajectory 
      analysis identified continuous waves of gene regulation as opposed to discrete 
      'partial' stages of EMT. KRAS was connected to the exit from the epithelial state 
      and the acquisition of a fully mesenchymal phenotype. A pooled single-cell 
      CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified EMT-associated receptors and transcription factors, 
      including regulators of KRAS, whose loss impeded progress along the EMT. Inhibiting 
      the KRAS effector MEK and its upstream activators EGFR and MET demonstrates that 
      interruption of key signaling events reveals regulatory 'checkpoints' in the EMT 
      continuum that mimic discrete stages, and reconciles opposing views of the program 
      that controls EMT.

TI  - A multiprotein supercomplex controlling oncogenic signalling in lymphoma.
PG  - 387-391
LID - 10.1038/s41586-018-0290-0 [doi]
AB  - B cell receptor (BCR) signalling has emerged as a therapeutic target in B cell 
      lymphomas, but inhibiting this pathway in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has 
      benefited only a subset of patients(1). Gene expression profiling identified two 
      major subtypes of DLBCL, known as germinal centre B cell-like and activated B 
      cell-like (ABC)(2,3), that show poor outcomes after immunochemotherapy in ABC. 
      Autoantigens drive BCR-dependent activation of NF-κB in ABC DLBCL through a kinase 
      signalling cascade of SYK, BTK and PKCβ to promote the assembly of the 
      CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 adaptor complex, which recruits and activates IκB kinase(4-6). 
      Genome sequencing revealed gain-of-function mutations that target the CD79A and 
      CD79B BCR subunits and the Toll-like receptor signalling adaptor MYD88(5,7), with 
      MYD88(L265P) being the most prevalent isoform. In a clinical trial, the BTK 
      inhibitor ibrutinib produced responses in 37% of cases of ABC(1). The most striking 
      response rate (80%) was observed in tumours with both CD79B and MYD88(L265P) 
      mutations, but how these mutations cooperate to promote dependence on BCR signalling 
      remains unclear. Here we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening and functional 
      proteomics to determine the molecular basis of exceptional clinical responses to 
      ibrutinib. We discovered a new mode of oncogenic BCR signalling in 
      ibrutinib-responsive cell lines and biopsies, coordinated by a multiprotein 
      supercomplex formed by MYD88, TLR9 and the BCR (hereafter termed the My-T-BCR 
      supercomplex). The My-T-BCR supercomplex co-localizes with mTOR on endolysosomes, 
      where it drives pro-survival NF-κB and mTOR signalling. Inhibitors of BCR and mTOR 
      signalling cooperatively decreased the formation and function of the My-T-BCR 
      supercomplex, providing mechanistic insight into their synergistic toxicity for 
      My-T-BCR(+) DLBCL cells. My-T-BCR supercomplexes characterized ibrutinib-responsive 
      malignancies and distinguished ibrutinib responders from non-responders. Our data 
      provide a framework for the rational design of oncogenic signalling inhibitors in 
      molecularly defined subsets of DLBCL.

AB  - Finding the components of cellular circuits and determining their functions 
      systematically remains a major challenge in mammalian cells. Here, we introduced 
      genome-wide pooled CRISPR-Cas9 libraries into dendritic cells (DCs) to identify 
      genes that control the induction of tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) by bacterial 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a key process in the host response to pathogens, mediated 
      by the Tlr4 pathway. We found many of the known regulators of Tlr4 signaling, as 
      well as dozens of previously unknown candidates that we validated. By measuring 
      protein markers and mRNA profiles in DCs that are deficient in known or candidate 
      genes, we classified the genes into three functional modules with distinct effects 
      on the canonical responses to LPS and highlighted functions for the PAF complex and 
      oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. Our findings uncover new facets of innate 
      immune circuits in primary cells and provide a genetic approach for dissection of 
      mammalian cell circuits.

TI  - In Vivo Epigenetic CRISPR Screen Identifies Asf1a as an Immunotherapeutic Target in 
      Kras-Mutant Lung Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 270-287
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0780 [doi]
AB  - Despite substantial progress in lung cancer immunotherapy, the overall response rate 
      in patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains low. Combining 
      standard immunotherapy with adjuvant approaches that enhance adaptive immune 
      responses-such as epigenetic modulation of antitumor immunity-is therefore an 
      attractive strategy. To identify epigenetic regulators of tumor immunity, we 
      constructed an epigenetic-focused single guide RNA library and performed an in vivo 
      CRISPR screen in a Kras (G12D)/Trp53 (-/-) LUAD model. Our data showed that loss of 
      the histone chaperone Asf1a in tumor cells sensitizes tumors to anti-PD-1 treatment. 
      Mechanistic studies revealed that tumor cell-intrinsic Asf1a deficiency induced 
      immunogenic macrophage differentiation in the tumor microenvironment by upregulating 
      GM-CSF expression and potentiated T-cell activation in combination with anti-PD-1. 
      Our results provide a rationale for a novel combination therapy consisting of ASF1A 
      inhibition and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Using an in vivo epigenetic 
      CRISPR screen, we identified Asf1a as a critical regulator of LUAD sensitivity to 
      anti-PD-1 therapy. Asf1a deficiency synergized with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy by 
      promoting M1-like macrophage polarization and T-cell activation. Thus, we provide a 
      new immunotherapeutic strategy for this subtype of patients with LUAD.See related 
      commentary by Menzel and Black, p. 179.This article is highlighted in the In This

TI  - Role of GUCA1C in Primary Congenital Glaucoma and in the Retina: Functional 
      Evaluation in Zebrafish.
LID - 10.3390/genes11050550 [doi]
LID - 550
AB  - Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a heterogeneous, inherited, and severe optical 
      neuropathy caused by apoptotic degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell layer. 
      Whole-exome sequencing analysis of one PCG family identified two affected siblings 
      who carried a low-frequency homozygous nonsense GUCA1C variant (c.52G > 
      T/p.Glu18Ter/rs143174402). This gene encodes GCAP3, a member of the guanylate 
      cyclase activating protein family, involved in phototransduction and with a 
      potential role in intraocular pressure regulation. Segregation analysis supported 
      the notion that the variant was coinherited with the disease in an autosomal 
      recessive fashion. GCAP3 was detected immunohistochemically in the adult human 
      ocular ciliary epithelium and retina. To evaluate the ocular effect of GUCA1C 
      loss-of-function, a guca1c knockout zebrafish line was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 
      genome editing. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of GCAP3 in the 
      non-pigmented ciliary epithelium and retina of adult wild-type fishes. Knockout 
      animals presented up-regulation of the glial fibrillary acidic protein in Müller 
      cells and evidence of retinal ganglion cell apoptosis, indicating the existence of 
      gliosis and glaucoma-like retinal damage. In summary, our data provide evidence for 
      the role of GUCA1C as a candidate gene in PCG and offer new insights into the 
      function of this gene in the ocular anterior segment and the retina.

AB  - 53BP1 controls a specialized non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway that is 
      essential for adaptive immunity, yet oncogenic in BRCA1 mutant cancers. 
      Intra-chromosomal DNA double-strand break (DSB) joining events during immunoglobulin 
      class switch recombination (CSR) require 53BP1. However, in BRCA1 mutant cells, 
      53BP1 blocks homologous recombination (HR) and promotes toxic NHEJ, resulting in 
      genomic instability. Here, we identify the protein dimerization hub-DYNLL1-as an 
      organizer of multimeric 53BP1 complexes. DYNLL1 binding stimulates 53BP1 
      oligomerization, and promotes 53BP1's recruitment to, and interaction with, 
      DSB-associated chromatin. Consequently, DYNLL1 regulates 53BP1-dependent NHEJ: CSR 
      is compromised upon deletion of Dynll1 or its transcriptional regulator Asciz, or by 
      mutation of DYNLL1 binding motifs in 53BP1; furthermore, Brca1 mutant cells and 
      tumours are rendered resistant to poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor 
      treatments upon deletion of Dynll1 or Asciz. Thus, our results reveal a mechanism 
      that regulates 53BP1-dependent NHEJ and the therapeutic response of BRCA1-deficient 
      cancers.

TI  - Characterization of host proteins interacting with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
      virus L protein.

AB  - RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) play a key role in the life cycle of RNA 
      viruses and impact their immunobiology. The arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
      virus (LCMV) strain Clone 13 provides a benchmark model for studying chronic 
      infection. A major genetic determinant for its ability to persist maps to a single 
      amino acid exchange in the viral L protein, which exhibits RdRp activity, yet its 
      functional consequences remain elusive. To unravel the L protein interactions with 
      the host proteome, we engineered infectious L protein-tagged LCMV virions by reverse 
      genetics. A subsequent mass-spectrometric analysis of L protein pulldowns from 
      infected human cells revealed a comprehensive network of interacting host proteins. 
      The obtained LCMV L protein interactome was bioinformatically integrated with known 
      host protein interactors of RdRps from other RNA viruses, emphasizing interconnected 
      modules of human proteins. Functional characterization of selected interactors 
      highlighted proviral (DDX3X) as well as antiviral (NKRF, TRIM21) host factors. To 
      corroborate these findings, we infected Trim21-/- mice with LCMV and found impaired 
      virus control in chronic infection. These results provide insights into the complex 
      interactions of the arenavirus LCMV and other viral RdRps with the host proteome and 
      contribute to a better molecular understanding of how chronic viruses interact with 
      their host.

TI  - CRISPR-SID: Identifying EZH2 as a druggable target for desmoid tumors via in vivo 
      dependency mapping.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2115116118 [doi]
LID - e2115116118
AB  - Cancer precision medicine implies identification of tumor-specific vulnerabilities 
      associated with defined oncogenic pathways. Desmoid tumors are soft-tissue neoplasms 
      strictly driven by Wnt signaling network hyperactivation. Despite this clearly 
      defined genetic etiology and the strict and unique implication of the Wnt/β-catenin 
      pathway, no specific molecular targets for these tumors have been identified. To 
      address this caveat, we developed fast, efficient, and penetrant genetic Xenopus 
      tropicalis desmoid tumor models to identify and characterize drug targets. We used 
      multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in these models to simultaneously target a 
      tumor suppressor gene (apc) and candidate dependency genes. Our methodology 
      CRISPR/Cas9 selection-mediated identification of dependencies (CRISPR-SID) uses 
      calculated deviations between experimentally observed gene editing outcomes and 
      deep-learning-predicted double-strand break repair patterns to identify genes under 
      negative selection during tumorigenesis. This revealed EZH2 and SUZ12, both encoding 
      polycomb repressive complex 2 components, and the transcription factor CREB3L1 as 
      genetic dependencies for desmoid tumors. In vivo EZH2 inhibition by Tazemetostat 
      induced partial regression of established autochthonous tumors. In vitro models of 
      patient desmoid tumor cells revealed a direct effect of Tazemetostat on Wnt pathway

AB  - Abnormalities in genetic and epigenetic modifications can lead to drastic changes in 
      gene expression profiles that are associated with various cancer types. Small cell 
      lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive and deadly form of lung cancer with limited 
      effective therapies currently available. By utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 
      dropout screen in SCLC cells, we identified paired box protein 9 (PAX9) as an 
      essential factor that is overexpressed in human malignant SCLC tumor samples and is 
      transcriptionally driven by the BAP1/ASXL3/BRD4 epigenetic axis. Genome-wide studies 
      revealed that PAX9 occupies distal enhancer elements and represses gene expression 
      by restricting enhancer activity. In multiple SCLC cell lines, genetic depletion of 
      PAX9 led to significant induction of a primed-active enhancer transition, resulting 
      in increased expression of a large number of neural differentiation and 
      tumor-suppressive genes. Mechanistically, PAX9 interacted and cofunctioned with the 
      nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex at enhancers to repress nearby 
      gene expression, which was reversed by pharmacologic HDAC inhibition. Overall, this 
      study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic function of the PAX9/NuRD 
      complex epigenetic axis in human SCLC and suggests that reactivation of primed 
      enhancers may have potential therapeutic efficacy in treating SCLC expressing high 
      levels of PAX9. SIGNIFICANCE: A genome-wide screen in small cell lung cancer reveals 
      PAX9/NuRD-mediated epigenetic enhancer silencing and tumor progression, supporting 
      the development of novel personalized therapeutic approaches targeting the 
      PAX9-regulated network.

      regulators of TAK-243 sensitivity.

AB  - TAK-243 is a first-in-class inhibitor of ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1 
      that catalyzes ubiquitin activation, the first step in the ubiquitylation cascade. 
      Based on its preclinical efficacy and tolerability, TAK-243 has been advanced to 
      phase I clinical trials in advanced malignancies. Nonetheless, the determinants of 
      TAK-243 sensitivity remain largely unknown. Here, we conducted a genome-wide 
      CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in the presence of 
      TAK-243 to identify genes essential for TAK-243 action. We identified BEN 
      domain-containing protein 3 (BEND3), a transcriptional repressor and a regulator of 
      chromatin organization, as the top gene whose knockout confers resistance to TAK-243 
      in vitro and in vivo. Knockout of BEND3 dampened TAK-243 effects on ubiquitylation, 
      proteotoxic stress, and DNA damage response. BEND3 knockout upregulated the 
      ATP-binding cassette efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; 
      ABCG2) and reduced the intracellular levelsof TAK-243. TAK-243 sensitivity 
      correlated with BCRP expression in cancer cell lines of different origins. Moreover, 
      chemical inhibition and genetic knockdown of BCRP sensitized intrinsically resistant 
      high-BCRP cells to TAK-243. Thus, our data demonstrate that BEND3 regulates the 
      expression of BCRP for which TAK-243 is a substrate. Moreover, BCRP expression could 
      serve as a predictor of TAK-243 sensitivity.

AB  - Maintenance of genome stability is essential for every living cell as genetic 
      information is repeatedly challenged during DNA replication in each cell division 
      event. Errors, defects, delays, and mistakes that arise during mitosis or meiosis 
      lead to an activation of DNA repair processes and in case of their failure, 
      programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis, could be initiated. Fam208a is a protein 
      whose importance in heterochromatin maintenance has been described recently. In this 
      work, we describe the crucial role of Fam208a in sustaining the genome stability 
      during the cellular division. The targeted depletion of Fam208a in mice using 
      CRISPR/Cas9 leads to embryonic lethality before E12.5. We also used the siRNA 
      approach to downregulate Fam208a in zygotes to avoid the influence of maternal RNA 
      in the early stages of development. This early downregulation increased arresting of 
      the embryonal development at the two-cell stage and occurrence of multipolar 
      spindles formation. To investigate this further, we used the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) 
      system and identified new putative interaction partners Gpsm2, Amn1, Eml1, Svil, and 
      Itgb3bp. Their co-expression with Fam208a was assessed by qRT-PCR profiling and in 
      situ hybridisation [1] in multiple murine tissues. Based on these results we 
      proposed that Fam208a functions within the HUSH complex by interaction with Mphosph8 
      as these proteins are not only able to physically interact but also co-localise. We 
      are bringing new evidence that Fam208a is multi-interacting protein affecting genome 
      stability on the level of cell division at the earliest stages of development and 
      also by interaction with methylation complex in adult tissues. In addition to its 
      epigenetic functions, Fam208a appears to have an additional role in zygotic 
      division, possibly via interaction with newly identified putative partners Gpsm2, 
      Amn1, Eml1, Svil, and Itgb3bp.

AB  - Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) play a central role in adaptive immunity by 
      transducing signals from the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) via production of PIP(3). 
      PI3Kδ is a heterodimer composed of a p110δ catalytic subunit associated with a p85α 
      or p85β regulatory subunit and is preferentially engaged by the TCR upon T cell 
      activation. The molecular mechanisms leading to PI3Kδ recruitment and activation at 
      the TCR signalosome remain unclear. In this study, we have used quantitative mass 
      spectrometry, biochemical approaches and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to uncover the 
      p110δ interactome in primary CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, we have determined how the 
      PI3Kδ interactome changes upon the differentiation of small naïve T cells into T 
      cell blasts expanded in the presence of IL-2. Our interactomic analyses identified 
      multiple constitutive and inducible PI3Kδ-interacting proteins, some of which were 
      common to naïve and previously-activated T cells. Our data reveals that PI3Kδ 
      rapidly interacts with as many as seven adaptor proteins upon TCR engagement, 
      including the Gab-family proteins, GAB2 and GAB3, a CD5-CBL signalosome and the 
      transmembrane proteins ICOS and TRIM. Our results also suggest that PI3Kδ pre-forms 
      complexes with the adaptors SH3KBP1 and CRKL in resting cells that could facilitate 
      the localization and activation of p110δ at the plasma membrane by forming ternary 
      complexes during early TCR signalling. Furthermore, we identify interactions that 
      were not previously known to occur in CD4(+) T cells, involving BCAP, GAB3, IQGAP3 
      and JAML. We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout in primary T cells to confirm 
      that BCAP is a positive regulator of PI3K-AKT signalling in CD4(+) T cell blasts. 
      Overall, our results provide evidence for a large protein network that regulates the 
      recruitment and activation of PI3Kδ in T cells. Finally, this work shows how the 
      PI3Kδ interactome is remodeled as CD4(+) T cells differentiate from naïve T cells to 
      activated T cell blasts. These activated T cells upregulate additional PI3Kδ adaptor 
      proteins, including BCAP, GAB2, IQGAP3 and ICOS. This rewiring of TCR-PI3K 
      signalling that occurs upon T cell differentiation may serve to reduce the threshold 
      of activation and diversify the inputs for the PI3K pathway in effector T cells.

TI  - Functional interrogation of HOXA9 regulome in MLLr leukemia via reporter-based 
      CRISPR/Cas9 screen.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.57858 [doi]
LID - e57858
AB  - Aberrant HOXA9 expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias, notably 
      those with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements. HOXA9 overexpression not only predicts 
      poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation 
      and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9 regulation in leukemia 
      is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the 
      HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing 
      the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors 
      controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion 
      significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell 
      proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell 
      proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut and Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of 
      USF2 at HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter 
      facilitated the functional interrogation of the HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our 
      understanding of the molecular regulation network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.

AB  - Identification of human disease signature genes typically requires samples from many 
      donors to achieve statistical significance. Here, we show that single-cell 
      heterogeneity analysis may overcome this hurdle by significantly improving the test 
      sensitivity. We analyzed the transcriptome of 39,905 single islets cells from 9 
      donors and observed distinct β cell heterogeneity trajectories associated with 
      obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore developed RePACT, a sensitive 
      single-cell analysis algorithm to identify both common and specific signature genes 
      for obesity and T2D. We mapped both β-cell-specific genes and disease signature 
      genes to the insulin regulatory network identified from a genome-wide CRISPR screen. 
      Our integrative analysis discovered the previously unrecognized roles of the cohesin 
      loading complex and the NuA4/Tip60 histone acetyltransferase complex in regulating 
      insulin transcription and release. Our study demonstrated the power of combining 
      single-cell heterogeneity analysis and functional genomics to dissect the etiology 
      of complex diseases.

TI  - Long non-coding RNA ChRO1 facilitates ATRX/DAXX-dependent H3.3 deposition for 
      transcription-associated heterochromatin reorganization.
PG  - 11759-11775
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky923 [doi]
AB  - Constitutive heterochromatin undergoes a dynamic clustering and spatial 
      reorganization during myogenic differentiation. However the detailed mechanisms and 
      its role in cell differentiation remain largely elusive. Here, we report the 
      identification of a muscle-specific long non-coding RNA, ChRO1, involved in 
      constitutive heterochromatin reorganization. ChRO1 is induced during terminal 
      differentiation of myoblasts, and is specifically localized to the chromocenters in 
      myotubes. ChRO1 is required for efficient cell differentiation, with global impacts 
      on gene expression. It influences DNA methylation and chromatin compaction at 
      peri/centromeric regions. Inhibition of ChRO1 leads to defects in the spatial fusion 
      of chromocenters, and mislocalization of H4K20 trimethylation, Suv420H2, HP1, 
      MeCP2 and cohesin. In particular, ChRO1 specifically associates with ATRX/DAXX/H3.3 
      complex at chromocenters to promote H3.3 incorporation and transcriptional induction 
      of satellite repeats, which is essential for chromocenter clustering. Thus, our 
      results unveil a mechanism involving a lncRNA that plays a role in large-scale 
      heterochromatin reorganization and cell differentiation.

      Glioblastoma Stem-like Cells.

AB  - To identify therapeutic targets for glioblastoma (GBM), we performed genome-wide 
      CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screens in patient-derived GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) and 
      human neural stem/progenitors (NSCs), non-neoplastic stem cell controls, for genes 
      required for their in vitro growth. Surprisingly, the vast majority GSC-lethal hits 
      were found outside of molecular networks commonly altered in GBM and GSCs (e.g., 
      oncogenic drivers). In vitro and in vivo validation of GSC-specific targets revealed 
      several strong hits, including the wee1-like kinase, PKMYT1/Myt1. Mechanistic 
      studies demonstrated that PKMYT1 acts redundantly with WEE1 to inhibit cyclin B-CDK1 
      activity via CDK1-Y15 phosphorylation and to promote timely completion of mitosis in 
      NSCs. However, in GSCs, this redundancy is lost, most likely as a result of 
      oncogenic signaling, causing GBM-specific lethality.

      a CRISPR-Cas9-based 'gene drive array' platform to facilitate efficient genetic 
      analysis in C. albicans. In our system, a modified DNA donor molecule acts as a 
      selfish genetic element, replaces the targeted site and propagates to replace 
      additional wild-type loci. Using mating-competent C. albicans haploids, each 
      carrying a different gene drive disabling a gene of interest, we are able to create 
      diploid strains that are homozygous double-deletion mutants. We generate double-gene 
      deletion libraries to demonstrate this technology, targeting antifungal efflux and 
      biofilm adhesion factors. We screen these libraries to identify virulence regulators 
      and determine how genetic networks shift under diverse conditions. This platform 
      transforms our ability to perform genetic interaction analysis in C. albicans and is 
      readily extended to other fungal pathogens.

TI  - CRNKL1 Is a Highly Selective Regulator of Intron-Retaining HIV-1 and Cellular mRNAs.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.02525-20 [doi]
LID - e02525-20
AB  - The HIV-1 Rev protein is a nuclear export factor for unspliced and incompletely 
      spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Without Rev, these intron-retaining RNAs are trapped in the 
      nucleus. A genome-wide screen identified nine proteins of the spliceosome, which all 
      enhanced expression from the HIV-1 unspliced RNA after CRISPR/Cas knockdown. 
      Depletion of DHX38, WDR70, and four proteins of the Prp19-associated complex (ISY1, 
      BUD31, XAB2, and CRNKL1) resulted in a more than 20-fold enhancement of unspliced 
      HIV-1 RNA levels in the cytoplasm. Targeting of CRNKL1, DHX38, and BUD31 affected 
      nuclear export efficiencies of the HIV-1 unspliced RNA to a much larger extent than 
      splicing. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that CRNKL1 also suppresses 
      cytoplasmic levels of a subset of cellular mRNAs, including some with selectively 
      retained introns. Thus, CRNKL1-dependent nuclear retention is a novel cellular 
      mechanism for the regulation of cytoplasmic levels of intron-retaining HIV-1 mRNAs, 
      which HIV-1 may have harnessed to direct its complex splicing pattern.IMPORTANCE To 
      regulate its complex splicing pattern, HIV-1 uses the adaptor protein Rev to shuttle 
      unspliced or partially spliced mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In the 
      absence of Rev, these RNAs are retained in the nucleus, but it is unclear why. Here 
      we identify cellular proteins whose depletion enhances cytoplasmic levels of the 
      HIV-1 unspliced RNA. Depletion of one of them, CRNKL1, also increases cytoplasmic 
      levels of a subset of intron-retaining cellular mRNA, suggesting that 
      CRNKL1-dependent nuclear retention may be a basic cellular mechanism exploited by 
      HIV-1.

TI  - Suppression of unwanted CRISPR-Cas9 editing by co-administration of catalytically 
      inactivating truncated guide RNAs.
PG  - 2697
LID - 10.1038/s41467-020-16542-9 [doi]
LID - 2697
AB  - CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases are powerful genome engineering tools, but unwanted cleavage 
      at off-target and previously edited sites remains a major concern. Numerous 
      strategies to reduce unwanted cleavage have been devised, but all are imperfect. 
      Here, we report that off-target sites can be shielded from the active Cas9•single 
      guide RNA (sgRNA) complex through the co-administration of dead-RNAs (dRNAs), 
      truncated guide RNAs that direct Cas9 binding but not cleavage. dRNAs can 
      effectively suppress a wide-range of off-targets with minimal optimization while 
      preserving on-target editing, and they can be multiplexed to suppress several 
      off-targets simultaneously. dRNAs can be combined with high-specificity Cas9 
      variants, which often do not eliminate all unwanted editing. Moreover, dRNAs can 
      prevent cleavage of homology-directed repair (HDR)-corrected sites, facilitating 
      scarless editing by eliminating the need for blocking mutations. Thus, we enable 
      precise genome editing by establishing a flexible approach for suppressing unwanted 
      editing of both off-targets and HDR-corrected sites.

TI  - Synthesizing AND gate minigene circuits based on CRISPReader for identification of 
      bladder cancer cells.

AB  - The logical AND gate gene circuit based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system can distinguish 
      bladder cancer cells from normal bladder epithelial cells. However, the layered 
      artificial gene circuits have the problems of high complexity, difficulty in 
      accurately predicting the behavior, and excessive redundancy, which cannot be 
      applied to clinical translation. Here, we construct minigene circuits based on the 
      CRISPReader, a technology used to control promoter-less gene expression in a robust 
      manner. The minigene circuits significantly induce robust gene expression output in 
      bladder cancer cells, but have nearly undetectable gene expression in normal bladder 
      epithelial cells. The minigene circuits show a higher capability for cancer 
      identification and intervention when compared with traditional gene circuits, and 
      could be used for in vivo cancer gene therapy using the all-in-one AAV vector. This 
      approach expands the design ideas and concepts of gene circuits in medical synthetic 
      biology.

TI  - Intronic CRISPR Repair in a Preclinical Model of Noonan Syndrome-Associated 
      Cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 1059-1076
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044794 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a multisystemic developmental disorder 
      characterized by common, clinically variable symptoms, such as typical facial 
      dysmorphisms, short stature, developmental delay, intellectual disability as well as 
      cardiac hypertrophy. The underlying mechanism is a gain-of-function of the 
      RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. However, our understanding 
      of the pathophysiological alterations and mechanisms, especially of the associated 
      cardiomyopathy, remains limited and effective therapeutic options are lacking. 
      METHODS: Here, we present a family with two siblings displaying an autosomal 
      recessive form of NS with massive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as clinically the most 
      prevalent symptom caused by biallelic mutations within the leucine zipper-like 
      transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1). We generated induced pluripotent stem 
      cell-derived cardiomyocytes of the affected siblings and investigated the 
      patient-specific cardiomyocytes on the molecular and functional level. RESULTS: 
      Patients' induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes recapitulated the 
      hypertrophic phenotype and uncovered a so-far-not-described causal link between 
      LZTR1 dysfunction, RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling hyperactivity, 
      hypertrophic gene response and cellular hypertrophy. Calcium channel blockade and 
      MEK inhibition could prevent some of the disease characteristics, providing a 
      molecular underpinning for the clinical use of these drugs in patients with NS, but 
      might not be a sustainable therapeutic option. In a proof-of-concept approach, we 
      explored a clinically translatable intronic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced 
      short palindromic repeats) repair and demonstrated a rescue of the hypertrophic 
      phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the human cardiac pathogenesis in 
      patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from NS 
      patients carrying biallelic variants in LZTR1 and identified a unique 
      disease-specific proteome signature. In addition, we identified the intronic CRISPR 
      repair as a personalized and in our view clinically translatable therapeutic 
      strategy to treat NS-associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Genome Mining and Comparative Pathogenomic Analysis of An Endemic 
      Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) Clone, 
      ST612-CC8-t1257-SCCmec_IVd(2B), Isolated in South Africa.

AB  - This study undertook genome mining and comparative genomics to gain genetic insights 
      into the dominance of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endemic 
      clone ST612-CC8-t1257-SCCmec_IVd(2B), obtained from the poultry food chain in South 
      Africa. Functional annotation of the genome revealed a vast array of similar central 
      metabolic, cellular and biochemical networks within the endemic clone crucial for 
      its survival in the microbial community. In-silico analysis of the clone revealed 
      the possession of uniform defense systems, restriction-modification system (type I 
      and IV), accessory gene regulator (type I), arginine catabolic mobile element (type 
      II), and type 1 clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat 
      (CRISPR)Cas array (N = 7 ± 1), which offer protection against exogenous attacks. The 
      estimated pathogenic potential predicted a higher probability (average P(score) ≈ 
      0.927) of the clone being pathogenic to its host. The clone carried a battery of 
      putative virulence determinants whose expression are critical for establishing 
      infection. However, there was a slight difference in their possession of adherence 
      factors (biofilm operon system) and toxins (hemolysins and enterotoxins). Further 
      analysis revealed a conserved environmental tolerance and persistence mechanisms 
      related to stress (oxidative and osmotic), heat shock, sporulation, bacteriocins, 
      and detoxification, which enable it to withstand lethal threats and contribute to 
      its success in diverse ecological niches. Phylogenomic analysis with close sister 
      lineages revealed that the clone was closely related to the MRSA isolate SHV713 from 
      Australia. The results of this bioinformatic analysis provide valuable insights into 
      the biology of this endemic clone.

TI  - Calmodulin-like protein 3 is an estrogen receptor alpha coregulator for gene 
      expression and drug response in a SNP, estrogen, and SERM-dependent fashion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously performed a case-control genome-wide association study in 
      women treated with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for breast cancer 
      prevention and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNF423 as 
      potential biomarkers for response to SERM therapy. The ZNF423rs9940645 SNP, which is 
      approximately 200 bp away from the estrogen response elements, resulted in the SNP, 
      estrogen, and SERM-dependent regulation of ZNF423 expression and, "downstream", that 
      of BRCA1. METHODS: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay-mass spectrometry was 
      performed to identify proteins binding to the ZNF423 SNP and coordinating with 
      estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing was applied to generate ZR75-1 breast cancer 
      cells with different ZNF423 SNP genotypes. Both cultured cells and mouse xenograft 
      models with different ZNF423 SNP genotypes were used to study the cellular responses 
      to SERMs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. RESULTS: We identified 
      calmodulin-like protein 3 (CALML3) as a key sensor of this SNP and a coregulator of 
      ERα, which contributes to differential gene transcription regulation in an estrogen 
      and SERM-dependent fashion. Furthermore, using CRISPR/Cas9-engineered ZR75-1 breast 
      cancer cells with different ZNF423 SNP genotypes, striking differences in cellular 
      responses to SERMs and PARP inhibitors, alone or in combination, were observed not 
      only in cells but also in a mouse xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have 
      demonstrated the mechanism by which the ZNF423 rs9940645 SNP might regulate gene 
      expression and drug response as well as its potential role in achieving more highly 
      individualized breast cancer therapy.

AB  - The insect brain is the central part of the neurosecretory system, which controls 
      morphology, physiology, and behavior during the insect's lifecycle. Lepidoptera are 
      holometabolous insects, and their brains develop during the larval period and 
      metamorphosis into the adult form. As the only fully domesticated insect, the 
      Lepidoptera silkworm Bombyx mori experienced changes in larval brain morphology and 
      certain behaviors during the domestication process. Hormonal regulation in insects 
      is a key factor in multiple processes. However, how juvenile hormone (JH) signals 
      regulate brain development in Lepidoptera species, especially in the larval stage, 
      remains elusive. We recently identified the JH receptor Methoprene tolerant 1 ( 
      Met1) as a putative domestication gene. How artificial selection on Met1 impacts 
      brain and behavioral domestication is another important issue addressing Darwin's 
      theory on domestication. Here, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Bombyx Met1 caused 
      developmental retardation in the brain, unlike precocious pupation of the cuticle. 
      At the whole transcriptome level, the ecdysteroid (20-hydroxyecdysone, 20E) 
      signaling and downstream pathways were overactivated in the mutant cuticle but not 
      in the brain. Pathways related to cell proliferation and specialization processes, 
      such as extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and tyrosine metabolism 
      pathways, were suppressed in the brain. Molecular evolutionary analysis and in vitro 
      assay identified an amino acid replacement located in a novel motif under positive 
      selection in B. mori, which decreased transcriptional binding activity. The B. mori 
      MET1 protein showed a changed structure and dynamic features, as well as a weakened 
      co-expression gene network, compared with B. mandarina. Based on comparative 
      transcriptomic analyses, we proposed a pathway downstream of JH signaling (i.e., 
      tyrosine metabolism pathway) that likely contributed to silkworm larval brain 
      development and domestication and highlighted the importance of the biogenic amine 
      system in larval evolution during silkworm domestication.

TI  - Identification of Functional Variants in the FAM13A Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary

AB  - RATIONALE: The identification of causal variants responsible for disease 
      associations from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) facilitates functional 
      understanding of the biological mechanisms by which those genetic variants influence 
      disease susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify causal variants in or near the 
      FAM13A (family with sequence similarity member 13A) GWAS locus associated with 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: We used an integrated 
      approach featuring conditional genetic analysis, massively parallel reporter assays 
      (MPRAs), traditional reporter assays, chromatin conformation capture assays, and 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based gene 
      editing to characterize COPD-associated regulatory variants in the FAM13A region in 
      human bronchial epithelial cell lines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Conditional 
      genetic association suggests the presence of two independent COPD association 
      signals in FAM13A. MPRAs identified 45 regulatory variants within FAM13A, among 
      which six variants were prioritized for further investigation. Three COPD-associated 
      variants demonstrated significant allele-specific activity in reporter assays. One 
      of three variants, rs2013701, was tested in the endogenous genomic context by 
      CRISPR-based genome editing that confirmed its allele-specific effects on FAM13A 
      expression and on cell proliferation, providing functional characterization for this 
      COPD-associated variant. CONCLUSIONS: The human GWAS association near FAM13A may 
      contain independent association signals. MPRAs identified multiple functional 
      variants in this region, including rs2013701, a putative COPD-causing variant with 
      allele-specific regulatory activity.

TI  - Rab29 activation of the Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 kinase.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.15252/embj.201798099 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease predisposing LRRK2 kinase phosphorylates a group of Rab GTPase 
      proteins including Rab29, within the effector-binding switch II motif. Previous work 
      indicated that Rab29, located within the PARK16 locus mutated in Parkinson's 
      patients, operates in a common pathway with LRRK2. Here, we show that Rab29 recruits 
      LRRK2 to the trans-Golgi network and greatly stimulates its kinase activity. 
      Pathogenic LRRK2 R1441G/C and Y1699C mutants that promote GTP binding are more 
      readily recruited to the Golgi and activated by Rab29 than wild-type LRRK2. We 
      identify conserved residues within the LRRK2 ankyrin domain that are required for 
      Rab29-mediated Golgi recruitment and kinase activation. Consistent with these 
      findings, knockout of Rab29 in A549 cells reduces endogenous LRRK2-mediated 
      phosphorylation of Rab10. We show that mutations that prevent LRRK2 from interacting 
      with either Rab29 or GTP strikingly inhibit phosphorylation of a cluster of highly 
      studied biomarker phosphorylation sites (Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973). Our 
      data reveal that Rab29 is a master regulator of LRRK2, controlling its activation, 
      localization, and potentially biomarker phosphorylation.

TI  - Mismatch-CRISPRi Reveals the Co-varying Expression-Fitness Relationships of 
      Essential Genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.

AB  - Essential genes are the hubs of cellular networks, but lack of high-throughput 
      methods for titrating gene expression has limited our understanding of the fitness 
      landscapes against which their expression levels are optimized. We developed a 
      modified CRISPRi system leveraging the predictable reduction in efficacy of 
      imperfectly matched sgRNAs to generate defined levels of CRISPRi activity and 
      demonstrated its broad applicability. Using libraries of mismatched sgRNAs predicted 
      to span the full range of knockdown levels, we characterized the expression-fitness 
      relationships of most essential genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We 
      find that these relationships vary widely from linear to bimodal but are similar 
      within pathways. Notably, despite ∼2 billion years of evolutionary separation 
      between E. coli and B. subtilis, most essential homologs have similar 
      expression-fitness relationships with rare but informative differences. Thus, the 
      expression levels of essential genes may reflect homeostatic or evolutionary 
      constraints shared between the two organisms.

TI  - Manipulating the position of DNA expression cassettes using location tags fused to 
      dCas9 (Cas9-Lag) to improve metabolic pathway efficiency.
PG  - 229
LID - 10.1186/s12934-020-01496-w [doi]
LID - 229
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) led to significant improvement of 
      CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques because it can be fused with a variety of functional 
      groups to form diverse molecular devices, which can manipulate or modify target DNA 
      cassettes. One important metabolic engineering strategy is to localize the enzymes 
      in proximity of their substrates for improved catalytic efficiency. In this work, we 
      developed a novel molecular device to manipulate the cellular location of specific 
      DNA cassettes either on plasmids or on the chromosome, by fusing location tags to 
      dCas9 (Cas9-Lag), and applied the technique for synthetic biology applications. 
      Carotenoids like β-carotene serve as common intermediates for the synthesis of 
      derivative compounds, which are hydrophobic and usually accumulate in the membrane 
      compartment. RESULTS: Carotenoids like β-carotene serve as common intermediates for 
      the synthesis of derivative compounds, which are hydrophobic and usually accumulate 
      in the membrane components. To improve the functional expression of membrane-bound 
      enzymes and localize them in proximity to the substrates, Cas9-Lag was used to pull 
      plasmids or chromosomal DNA expressing carotenoid enzymes onto the cell membrane. 
      For this purpose, dCas9 was fused to the E. coli membrane docking tag GlpF, and gRNA 
      was designed to direct this fusion protein to the DNA expression cassettes. With 
      Cas9-Lag, the zeaxanthin and astaxanthin titer increased by 29.0% and 26.7% 
      respectively. Due to experimental limitations, the electron microscopy images of 
      cells expressing Cas9-Lag vaguely indicated that GlpF-Cas9 might have pulled the 
      target DNA cassettes in close proximity to membrane. Similarly, protein mass 
      spectrometry analysis of membrane proteins suggested an increased expression of 
      carotenoid-converting enzymes in the membrane components. CONCLUSION: This work 
      therefore provides a novel molecular device, Cas9-Lag, which was proved to increase 
      zeaxanthin and astaxanthin production and might be used to manipulate DNA cassette 
      location.

TI  - CPAMD8 loss-of-function underlies non-dominant congenital glaucoma with variable 
      anterior segment dysgenesis and abnormal extracellular matrix.
PG  - 1209-1231
LID - 10.1007/s00439-020-02164-0 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal development of the ocular anterior segment may lead to a spectrum of 
      clinical phenotypes ranging from primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) to variable 
      anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). The main objective of this study was to identify 
      the genetic alterations underlying recessive congenital glaucoma with ASD (CG-ASD). 
      Next-generation DNA sequencing identified rare biallelic CPAMD8 variants in four 
      patients with CG-ASD and in one case with PCG. CPAMD8 is a gene of unknown function 
      and recently associated with ASD. Bioinformatic and in vitro functional evaluation 
      of the variants using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and minigene analysis 
      supported a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism. Optical and electron microscopy 
      of the trabeculectomy specimen from one of the CG-ASD cases revealed an abnormal 
      anterior chamber angle, with altered extracellular matrix, and apoptotic trabecular 
      meshwork cells. The CPAMD8 protein was immunodetected in adult human ocular fluids 
      and anterior segment tissues involved in glaucoma and ASD (i.e., aqueous humor, 
      non-pigmented ciliary epithelium, and iris muscles), as well as in periocular 
      mesenchyme-like cells of zebrafish embryos. CRISPR/Cas9 disruption of this gene in 
      F0 zebrafish embryos (96 hpf) resulted in varying degrees of gross developmental 
      abnormalities, including microphthalmia, pharyngeal maldevelopment, and pericardial 
      and periocular edemas. Optical and electron microscopy examination of these embryos 
      showed iridocorneal angle hypoplasia (characterized by altered iris stroma cells, 
      reduced anterior chamber, and collagen disorganized corneal stroma extracellular 
      matrix), recapitulating some patients' features. Our data support the notion that 
      CPAMD8 loss-of-function underlies a spectrum of recessive CG-ASD phenotypes 
      associated with extracellular matrix disorganization and provide new insights into 
      the normal and disease roles of this gene.

TI  - Transcriptional consequences of MBD5 disruption in mouse brain and CRISPR-derived 
      neurons.
PG  - 45

AB  - BACKGROUND: MBD5, encoding the methyl-CpG-binding domain 5 protein, has been 
      proposed as a necessary and sufficient driver of the 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome. 
      De novo missense and protein-truncating variants from exome sequencing studies have 
      directly implicated MBD5 in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 
      related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, little is known concerning the 
      specific function(s) of MBD5. METHODS: To gain insight into the complex interactions 
      associated with alteration of MBD5 in individuals with ASD and related NDDs, we 
      explored the transcriptional landscape of MBD5 haploinsufficiency across multiple 
      mouse brain regions of a heterozygous hypomorphic Mbd5(+/GT) mouse model, and 
      compared these results to CRISPR-mediated mutations of MBD5 in human iPSC-derived 
      neuronal models. RESULTS: Gene expression analyses across three brain regions from 
      Mbd5(+/GT) mice showed subtle transcriptional changes, with cortex displaying the 
      most widespread changes following Mbd5 reduction, indicating context-dependent 
      effects. Comparison with MBD5 reduction in human neuronal cells reinforced the 
      context-dependence of gene expression changes due to MBD5 deficiency. Gene 
      co-expression network analyses revealed gene clusters that were associated with 
      reduced MBD5 expression and enriched for terms related to ciliary function. 
      LIMITATIONS: These analyses included a limited number of mouse brain regions and 
      neuronal models, and the effects of the gene knockdown are subtle. As such, these 
      results will not reflect the full extent of MBD5 disruption across human brain 
      regions during early neurodevelopment in ASD, or capture the diverse spectrum of 
      cell-type-specific changes associated with MBD5 alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      points to modest and context-dependent transcriptional consequences of Mbd5 
      disruption in the brain. It also suggests a possible link between MBD5 and 
      perturbations in ciliary function, which is an established pathogenic mechanism in 
      developmental disorders and syndromes.

TI  - Epigenetic and Transcriptional Control of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 
      Regulates the Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Pancreatic Cancer.
PG  - 736-753
LID - 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0519 [doi]
AB  - Although immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer care, patients with pancreatic 
      ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) rarely respond to these treatments, a failure that is 
      attributed to poor infiltration and activation of T cells in the tumor 
      microenvironment (TME). We performed an in vivo CRISPR screen and identified lysine 
      demethylase 3A (KDM3A) as a potent epigenetic regulator of immunotherapy response in 
      PDA. Mechanistically, KDM3A acts through Krueppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) and SMAD 
      family member 4 (SMAD4) to regulate the expression of the epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR). Ablation of KDM3A, KLF5, SMAD4, or EGFR in tumor cells altered the 
      immune TME and sensitized tumors to combination immunotherapy, whereas treatment of 
      established tumors with an EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, prompted a dose-dependent 
      increase in intratumoral T cells. This study defines an epigenetic-transcriptional 
      mechanism by which tumor cells modulate their immune microenvironment and highlights 
      the potential of EGFR inhibitors as immunotherapy sensitizers in PDA. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      PDA remains refractory to immunotherapies. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR 
      screen and identified an epigenetic-transcriptional network that regulates antitumor 
      immunity by converging on EGFR. Pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR is sufficient to 
      rewire the immune microenvironment. These results offer a readily accessible 
      immunotherapy-sensitizing strategy for PDA.This article is highlighted in the In 
      This Issue feature, p. 521.

AB  - Although the pathogen recognition receptor pathways that activate cell-intrinsic 
      antiviral responses are well delineated, less is known about how the host regulates 
      this response to prevent sustained signaling and possible immune-mediated damage. 
      Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to identify host factors that 
      modulate interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, we identified the DNA binding 
      protein Barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (Banf1), a previously described 
      inhibitor of retrovirus integration, as a modulator of basal cell-intrinsic 
      immunity. Ablation of Banf1 by gene editing resulted in chromatin activation near 
      host defense genes with associated increased expression of ISGs, including Oas2, 
      Rsad2 (viperin), Ifit1, and ISG15 The phenotype in Banf1-deficient cells occurred 
      through a cGAS-, STING-, and IRF3-dependent signaling axis, was associated with 
      reduced infection of RNA and DNA viruses, and was reversed in Banf1 complemented 
      cells. Confocal microscopy and biochemical studies revealed that a loss of Banf1 
      expression resulted in higher level of cytosolic double-stranded DNA at baseline. 
      Our study identifies an undescribed role for Banf1 in regulating the levels of 
      cytoplasmic DNA and cGAS-dependent ISG homeostasis and suggests possible therapeutic 
      directions for promoting or inhibiting cell-intrinsic innate immune 
      responses.IMPORTANCE Although the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway is a key host 
      mechanism to restrict infection of a diverse range of viral pathogens, its 
      unrestrained activity either at baseline or in the context of an immune response can 
      result in host cell damage and injury. Here, we used a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 
      screen and identified the DNA binding protein Barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 
      (Banf1) as a modulator of basal cell-intrinsic immunity. A loss of Banf1 expression 
      resulted in higher level of cytosolic double-stranded DNA at baseline, which 
      triggered IFN-stimulated gene expression via a cGAS-STING-IRF3 axis that did not 
      require type I IFN or STAT1 signaling. Our experiments define a regulatory network 
      in which Banf1 limits basal inflammation by preventing self DNA accumulation in the 
      cytosol.

      CRISPR-mediated clock gene disruption.

LID - e48308
AB  - In Drosophila, ~150 neurons expressing molecular clock proteins regulate circadian 
      behavior. Sixteen of these neurons secrete the neuropeptide Pdf and have been called 
      'master pacemakers' because they are essential for circadian rhythms. A subset of 
      Pdf(+) neurons (the morning oscillator) regulates morning activity and communicates 
      with other non-Pdf(+) neurons, including a subset called the evening oscillator. It 
      has been assumed that the molecular clock in Pdf(+) neurons is required for these 
      functions. To test this, we developed and validated Gal4-UAS based CRISPR tools for 
      cell-specific disruption of key molecular clock components, period and timeless. 
      While loss of the molecular clock in both the morning and evening oscillators 
      eliminates circadian locomotor activity, the molecular clock in either oscillator 
      alone is sufficient to rescue circadian locomotor activity in the absence of the 
      other. This suggests that clock neurons do not act in a hierarchy but as a 
      distributed network to regulate circadian activity.

AB  - Resistance to chemotherapy plays a significant role in cancer mortality. To identify 
      genetic units affecting sensitivity to cytarabine, the mainstay of treatment for 
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we developed a comprehensive and integrated 
      genome-wide platform based on a dual protein-coding and non-coding integrated 
      CRISPRa screening (DICaS). Putative resistance genes were initially identified using 
      pharmacogenetic data from 760 human pan-cancer cell lines. Subsequently, genome 
      scale functional characterization of both coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) 
      genes by CRISPR activation was performed. For lncRNA functional assessment, we 
      developed a CRISPR activation of lncRNA (CaLR) strategy, targeting 14,701 lncRNA 
      genes. Computational and functional analysis identified novel cell-cycle, 
      survival/apoptosis, and cancer signaling genes. Furthermore, transcriptional 
      activation of the GAS6-AS2 lncRNA, identified in our analysis, leads to 
      hyperactivation of the GAS6/TAM pathway, a resistance mechanism in multiple cancers 
      including AML. Thus, DICaS represents a novel and powerful approach to identify 
      integrated coding and non-coding pathways of therapeutic relevance.

TI  - foxm1 Modulates Cell Non-Autonomous Response in Zebrafish Skeletal Muscle 
      Homeostasis.
LID - 10.3390/cells10051241 [doi]
LID - 1241
AB  - foxm1 is a master regulator of the cell cycle, contributing to cell proliferation. 
      Recent data have shown that this transcription factor also modulates gene networks 
      associated with other cellular mechanisms, suggesting non-proliferative functions 
      that remain largely unexplored. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt foxm1 
      in the zebrafish terminally differentiated fast-twitching muscle cells. foxm1 
      genomic disruption increased myofiber death and clearance. Interestingly, this 
      contributed to non-autonomous satellite cell activation and proliferation. Moreover, 
      we observed that Cas9 expression alone was strongly deleterious to muscle cells. Our 
      report shows that foxm1 modulates a muscle non-autonomous response to myofiber death 
      and highlights underreported toxicity to high expression of Cas9 in vivo.

TI  - MNK1/NODAL Signaling Promotes Invasive Progression of Breast Ductal Carcinoma In 
      Situ.
PG  - 1646-1657
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1602 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms by which breast cancers progress from relatively indolent ductal 
      carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) are not well understood. 
      However, this process is critical to the acquisition of metastatic potential. 
      MAPK-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (MNK1) signaling can promote cell 
      invasion. NODAL, a morphogen essential for embryogenic patterning, is often 
      reexpressed in breast cancer. Here we describe a MNK1/NODAL signaling axis that 
      promotes DCIS progression to IDC. We generated MNK1 knockout (KO) or constitutively 
      active MNK1 (caMNK1)-expressing human MCF-10A-derived DCIS cell lines, which were 
      orthotopically injected into the mammary glands of mice. Loss of MNK1 repressed 
      NODAL expression, inhibited DCIS to IDC conversion, and decreased tumor relapse and 
      metastasis. Conversely, caMNK1 induced NODAL expression and promoted IDC. The 
      MNK1/NODAL axis promoted cancer stem cell properties and invasion in vitro. The 
      MNK1/2 inhibitor SEL201 blocked DCIS progression to invasive disease in vivo. In 
      clinical samples, IDC and DCIS with microinvasion expressed higher levels of 
      phospho-MNK1 and NODAL versus low-grade (invasion-free) DCIS. Cumulatively, our data 
      support further development of MNK1 inhibitors as therapeutics for preventing 
      invasive disease. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings provide new mechanistic insight into 
      progression of ductal carcinoma and support clinical application of MNK1 inhibitors 
      to delay progression of indolent ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive ductal 
      carcinoma.

TI  - Identification of an emphysema-associated genetic variant near TGFB2 with regulatory 
      effects in lung fibroblasts.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.42720 [doi]
LID - e42720
AB  - Murine studies have linked TGF-β signaling to emphysema, and human genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) studies of lung function and COPD have identified 
      associated regions near genes in the TGF-β superfamily. However, the functional 
      regulatory mechanisms at these loci have not been identified. We performed the 
      largest GWAS of emphysema patterns to date, identifying 10 GWAS loci including an 
      association peak spanning a 200 kb region downstream from TGFB2. Integrative 
      analysis of publicly available eQTL, DNaseI, and chromatin conformation data 
      identified a putative functional variant, rs1690789, that may regulate TGFB2 
      expression in human fibroblasts. Using chromatin conformation capture, we confirmed 
      that the region containing rs1690789 contacts the TGFB2 promoter in fibroblasts, and 
      CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted deletion of a ~ 100 bp region containing rs1690789 resulted in 
      decreased TGFB2 expression in primary human lung fibroblasts. These data provide 
      novel mechanistic evidence linking genetic variation affecting the TGF-β pathway to 
      emphysema in humans.

      cytoskeletal tension and adhesion.

AB  - During morphogenesis, molecular mechanisms that orchestrate biomechanical dynamics 
      across cells remain unclear. Here, we show a role of guidance receptor Plexin-B2 in 
      organizing actomyosin network and adhesion complexes during multicellular 
      development of human embryonic stem cells and neuroprogenitor cells. Plexin-B2 
      manipulations affect actomyosin contractility, leading to changes in cell stiffness 
      and cytoskeletal tension, as well as cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion. We have 
      delineated the functional domains of Plexin-B2, RAP1/2 effectors, and the signaling 
      association with ERK1/2, calcium activation, and YAP mechanosensor, thus providing a 
      mechanistic link between Plexin-B2-mediated cytoskeletal tension and stem cell 
      physiology. Plexin-B2-deficient stem cells exhibit premature lineage commitment, and 
      a balanced level of Plexin-B2 activity is critical for maintaining cytoarchitectural 
      integrity of the developing neuroepithelium, as modeled in cerebral organoids. Our 
      studies thus establish a significant function of Plexin-B2 in orchestrating 
      cytoskeletal tension and cell-cell/cell-matrix adhesion, therefore solidifying the 
      importance of collective cell mechanics in governing stem cell physiology and tissue 
      morphogenesis.

AB  - Point mutations in cancer have been extensively studied but chromosomal gains and 
      losses have been more challenging to interpret due to their unspecific nature. Here 
      we examine high-resolution allelic imbalance (AI) landscape in 1699 colorectal 
      cancers, 256 of which have been whole-genome sequenced (WGSed). The imbalances 
      pinpoint 38 genes as plausible AI targets based on previous knowledge. Unbiased 
      CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and activation screens identified in total 79 genes within AI 
      peaks regulating cell growth. Genetic and functional data implicate loss of TP53 as 
      a sufficient driver of AI. The WGS highlights an influence of copy number 
      aberrations on the rate of detected somatic point mutations. Importantly, the data 
      reveal several associations between AI target genes, suggesting a role for a network 
      of lineage-determining transcription factors in colorectal tumorigenesis. Overall, 
      the results unravel the contribution of AI in colorectal cancer and provide a 
      plausible explanation why so few genes are commonly affected by point mutations in 
      cancers.

AB  - Single-cell CRISPR screens enable the exploration of mammalian gene function and 
      genetic regulatory networks. However, use of this technology has been limited by 
      reliance on indirect indexing of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Here we present 
      direct-capture Perturb-seq, a versatile screening approach in which expressed sgRNAs 
      are sequenced alongside single-cell transcriptomes. Direct-capture Perturb-seq 
      enables detection of multiple distinct sgRNA sequences from individual cells and 
      thus allows pooled single-cell CRISPR screens to be easily paired with combinatorial 
      perturbation libraries that contain dual-guide expression vectors. We demonstrate 
      the utility of this approach for high-throughput investigations of genetic 
      interactions and, leveraging this ability, dissect epistatic interactions between 
      cholesterol biogenesis and DNA repair. Using direct capture Perturb-seq, we also 
      show that targeting individual genes with multiple sgRNAs per cell improves efficacy 
      of CRISPR interference and activation, facilitating the use of compact, highly 
      active CRISPR libraries for single-cell screens. Last, we show that 
      hybridization-based target enrichment permits sensitive, specific sequencing of 
      informative transcripts from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) risk-associated SNPs are enriched in noncoding cis-regulatory 
      elements (rCREs), yet their modi operandi and clinical impact remain elusive. Here, 
      we perform CRISPRi screens of 260 rCREs in PCa cell lines. We find that rCREs 
      harboring high risk SNPs are more essential for cell proliferation and H3K27ac 
      occupancy is a strong indicator of essentiality. We also show that 
      cell-line-specific essential rCREs are enriched in the 8q24.21 region, with the 
      rs11986220-containing rCRE regulating MYC and PVT1 expression, cell proliferation 
      and tumorigenesis in a cell-line-specific manner, depending on DNA 
      methylation-orchestrated occupancy of a CTCF binding site in between this rCRE and 
      the MYC promoter. We demonstrate that CTCF deposition at this site as measured by 
      DNA methylation level is highly variable in prostate specimens, and observe the MYC 
      eQTL in the 8q24.21 locus in individuals with low CTCF binding. Together our 
      findings highlight a causal mechanism synergistically driven by a risk SNP and DNA 
      methylation-mediated 3D genome architecture, advocating for the integration of 
      genetics and epigenetics in assessing risks conferred by genetic predispositions.

AB  - Seed germination is essential for ensuring grain yield and quality. Germination 
      rate, uniformity, and post-germination growth all contribute to cultivation. 
      Although the phytohormones gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroid (BR) are known to 
      regulate germination, the underlying mechanism of their crosstalk in co-regulating 
      rice seed germination remains unclear. In this study, the isobaric tags for relative 
      and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomic approach was employed to identify target 
      proteins responsive to GA during recovery of germination in BR-deficient and 
      BR-insensitive rice. A total of 42 differentially abundant proteins were identified 
      in both BR-deficient and BR-insensitive plants, and most were altered consistently 
      in the two groups. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed enrichment in proteins with 
      binding and catalytic activity. A potential protein-protein interaction network was 
      constructed using STRING analysis, and five Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) family 
      members were markedly down-regulated at both mRNA transcript and protein levels. 
      These LEA genes were specifically expressed in rice seeds, especially during the 
      latter stages of seed development. Mutation of LEA33 affected rice grain size and 
      seed germination, possibly by reducing BR accumulation and enhancing GA 
      biosynthesis. The findings improve our knowledge of the mechanisms by which GA and 
      BR coordinate seed germination.

TI  - A Recurrent ERCC3 Truncating Mutation Confers Moderate Risk for Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1267-1275
AB  - Known gene mutations account for approximately 50% of the hereditary risk for breast 
      cancer. Moderate and low penetrance variants, discovered by genomic approaches, 
      account for an as-yet-unknown proportion of the remaining heritability. A truncating 
      mutation c.325C>T:p.Arg109* (R109X) in the ATP-dependent helicase ERCC3 was observed 
      recurrently among exomes sequenced in BRCA wild-type, breast cancer-affected 
      individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Modeling of the mutation in 
      ERCC3-deficient or CRISPR/Cas9-edited cell lines showed a consistent pattern of 
      reduced expression of the protein and concomitant hypomorphic functionality when 
      challenged with UVC exposure or treatment with the DNA alkylating agent IlludinS. 
      Overexpressing the mutant protein in ERCC3-deficient cells only partially rescued 
      their DNA repair-deficient phenotype. Comparison of frequency of this recurrent 
      mutation in over 6,500 chromosomes of breast cancer cases and 6,800 Ashkenazi 
      controls showed significant association with breast cancer risk (OR(BC) = 1.53, 
      OR(ER+) = 1.73), particularly for the estrogen receptor-positive subset (P < 0.007). 
      SIGNIFICANCE: A functionally significant recurrent ERCC3 mutation increased the risk 
      for breast cancer in a genetic isolate. Mutated cell lines showed lower survival 
      after in vitro exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Thus, similar to tumors arising in 
      the background of homologous repair defects, mutations in nucleotide excision repair 
      genes such as ERCC3 could constitute potential therapeutic targets in a subset of 
      hereditary breast cancers. Cancer Discov; 6(11); 1267-75. ©2016 AACR.This article is

AB  - Chronic active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, a hallmark of the activated B 
      cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), engages the 
      CARD11-MALT1-BCL10 (CBM) adapter complex to activate IκB kinase (IKK) and the 
      classical NF-κB pathway. Here we show that the CBM complex includes the E3 ubiquitin 
      ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2, which are essential mediators of BCR-dependent NF-κB 
      activity in ABC DLBCL. cIAP1/2 attach K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on themselves 
      and on BCL10, resulting in the recruitment of IKK and the linear ubiquitin chain 
      ligase LUBAC, which is essential for IKK activation. SMAC mimetics target cIAP1/2 
      for destruction, and consequently suppress NF-κB and selectively kill BCR-dependent 
      ABC DLBCL lines, supporting their clinical evaluation in patients with ABC DLBCL.

AB  - Improving effector activity of antigen-specific T cells is a major goal in cancer 
      immunotherapy. Despite the identification of several effector T cell 
      (T(EFF))-driving transcription factors (TFs), the transcriptional coordination of 
      T(EFF) biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR 
      screening platform and identified a key mechanism restraining T(EFF) biology through 
      the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced T(EFF) responses without 
      compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained T(EFF) lineage 
      differentiation by binding to cis-regulatory elements of effector-associated genes. 
      Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs, allowing more 
      efficient Runx3-driven T(EFF) biology. CD8(+) T cells lacking Fli1 provided 
      substantially better protection against multiple infections and tumors. These data 
      indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing CD8(+) T cell transcriptional landscape 
      from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven T(EFF) cell differentiation. Moreover, genetic 
      deletion of Fli1 improves T(EFF) differentiation and protective immunity in 
      infections and cancer.

TI  - Cubilin-, megalin-, and Dab2-dependent transcription revealed by CRISPR/Cas9 
      knockout in kidney proximal tubule cells.
PG  - F14-F26
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00259.2021 [doi]
AB  - The multiligand receptors megalin (Lrp2) and cubilin (Cubn) and their endocytic 
      adaptor protein Dab2 (Dab2) play essential roles in maintaining the integrity of the 
      apical endocytic pathway of proximal tubule (PT) cells and have complex and poorly 
      understood roles in the development of chronic kidney disease. Here, we used 
      RNA-sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) technology in a well-differentiated 
      cell culture model to identify PT-specific transcriptional changes that are directly 
      consequent to the loss of megalin, cubilin, or Dab2 expression. KO of Lrp2 had the 
      greatest transcriptional effect, and nearly all genes whose expression was affected 
      in Cubn KO and Dab2 KO cells were also changed in Lrp2 KO cells. Pathway analysis 
      and more granular inspection of the altered gene profiles suggested changes in 
      pathways with immunomodulatory functions that might trigger the pathological changes 
      observed in KO mice and patients with Donnai-Barrow syndrome. In addition, 
      differences in transcription patterns between Lrp2 and Dab2 KO cells suggested the 
      possibility that altered spatial signaling by aberrantly localized receptors 
      contributes to transcriptional changes upon the disruption of PT endocytic function. 
      A reduction in transcripts encoding sodium-glucose cotransporter isoform 2 was 
      confirmed in Lrp2 KO mouse kidney lysates by quantitative PCR analysis. Our results 
      highlight the role of megalin as a master regulator and coordinator of ion 
      transport, metabolism, and endocytosis in the PT. Compared with the studies in 
      animal models, this approach provides a means to identify PT-specific 
      transcriptional changes that are directly consequent to the loss of these target 
      genes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Megalin and cubilin receptors together with their adaptor 
      protein Dab2 represent major components of the endocytic machinery responsible for 
      efficient uptake of filtered proteins by the proximal tubule (PT). Dab2 and megalin 
      expression have been implicated as both positive and negative modulators of kidney 
      disease. We used RNA sequencing to knock out CRISPR/Cas9 cubilin, megalin, and Dab2 
      in highly differentiated PT cells to identify PT-specific changes that are directly 
      consequent to knockout of each component.

TI  - Reduced RBPMS Levels Promote Cell Proliferation and Decrease Cisplatin Sensitivity 
      in Ovarian Cancer Cells.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23010535 [doi]
LID - 535
AB  - Worldwide, the number of cancer-related deaths continues to increase due to the 
      ability of cancer cells to become chemotherapy-resistant and metastasize. For women 
      with ovarian cancer, a staggering 70% will become resistant to the front-line 
      therapy, cisplatin. Although many mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have been 
      proposed, the key mechanisms of such resistance remain elusive. The RNA binding 
      protein with multiple splicing (RBPMS) binds to nascent RNA transcripts and 
      regulates splicing, transport, localization, and stability. Evidence indicates that 
      RBPMS also binds to protein members of the AP-1 transcription factor complex 
      repressing its activity. Until now, little has been known about the biological 
      function of RBPMS in ovarian cancer. Accordingly, we interrogated available Internet 
      databases and found that ovarian cancer patients with high RBPMS levels live longer 
      compared to patients with low RBPMS levels. Similarly, immunohistochemical (IHC) 
      analysis in a tissue array of ovarian cancer patient samples showed that serous 
      ovarian cancer tissues showed weaker RBPMS staining when compared with normal 
      ovarian tissues. We generated clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR)-mediated RBPMS knockout vectors that were stably transfected in the 
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR3. The knockout of RBPMS in these 
      cells was confirmed via bioinformatics analysis, real-time PCR, and Western blot 
      analysis. We found that the RBPMS knockout clones grew faster and had increased 
      invasiveness than the control CRISPR clones. RBPMS knockout also reduced the 
      sensitivity of the OVCAR3 cells to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, β-galactosidase 
      (β-Gal) measurements showed that RBPMS knockdown induced senescence in ovarian 
      cancer cells. We performed RNAseq in the RBPMS knockout clones and identified 
      several downstream-RBPMS transcripts, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and 
      protein-coding genes associated with alteration of the tumor microenvironment as 
      well as those with oncogenic or tumor suppressor capabilities. Moreover, proteomic 
      studies confirmed that RBPMS regulates the expression of proteins involved in cell 
      detoxification, RNA processing, and cytoskeleton network and cell integrity. 
      Interrogation of the Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter database identified multiple 
      downstream-RBPMS effectors that could be used as prognostic and response-to-therapy 
      biomarkers in ovarian cancer. These studies suggest that RBPMS acts as a tumor 
      suppressor gene and that lower levels of RBPMS promote the cisplatin resistance of 
      ovarian cancer cells.

TI  - Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies HNRNPL as a prostate cancer dependency 
      regulating RNA splicing.
PG  - E5207-E5215
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1617467114 [doi]
AB  - Alternative RNA splicing plays an important role in cancer. To determine which 
      factors involved in RNA processing are essential in prostate cancer, we performed a 
      genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen to identify the genes that are required for 
      prostate cancer growth. Functional annotation defined a set of essential spliceosome 
      and RNA binding protein (RBP) genes, including most notably heterogeneous nuclear 
      ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL). We defined the HNRNPL-bound RNA landscape by RNA 
      immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing and linked these RBP-RNA 
      interactions to changes in RNA processing. HNRNPL directly regulates the alternative 
      splicing of a set of RNAs, including those encoding the androgen receptor, the key 
      lineage-specific prostate cancer oncogene. HNRNPL also regulates circular RNA 
      formation via back splicing. Importantly, both HNRNPL and its RNA targets are 
      aberrantly expressed in human prostate tumors, supporting their clinical relevance. 
      Collectively, our data reveal HNRNPL and its RNA clients as players in prostate 
      cancer growth and potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - Mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene cause autosomal 
      dominant frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). MAPT 
      p.R406W carriers present clinically with progressive memory loss and 
      neuropathologically with neuronal and glial tauopathy. However, the pathogenic 
      events triggered by the expression of the mutant tau protein remain poorly 
      understood. To identify the genes and pathways that are dysregulated in FTLD-tau, we 
      performed transcriptomic analyses in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 
      neurons carrying MAPT p.R406W and CRISPR/Cas9-corrected isogenic controls. We found 
      that the expression of the MAPT p.R406W mutation was sufficient to create a 
      significantly different transcriptomic profile compared with that of the isogeneic 
      controls and to cause the differential expression of 328 genes. Sixty-one of these 
      genes were also differentially expressed in the same direction between MAPT p.R406W 
      carriers and pathology-free human control brains. We found that genes differentially 
      expressed in the stem cell models and human brains were enriched for pathways 
      involving gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and pre-synaptic function. The 
      expression of GABA receptor genes, including GABRB2 and GABRG2, were consistently 
      reduced in iPSC-derived neurons and brains from MAPT p.R406W carriers. 
      Interestingly, we found that GABA receptor genes, including GABRB2 and GABRG2, are 
      significantly lower in symptomatic mouse models of tauopathy, as well as in brains 
      with progressive supranuclear palsy. Genome wide association analyses reveal that 
      common variants within GABRB2 are associated with increased risk for frontotemporal 
      dementia (P < 1 × 10(-3)). Thus, our systems biology approach, which leverages 
      molecular data from stem cells, animal models, and human brain tissue can reveal 
      novel disease mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that MAPT p.R406W is sufficient to 
      induce changes in GABA-mediated signaling and synaptic function, which may 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of FTLD-tau and other primary tauopathies.

TI  - Loss of C2orf69 defines a fatal autoinflammatory syndrome in humans and zebrafish 
      that evokes a glycogen-storage-associated mitochondriopathy.

AB  - Human C2orf69 is an evolutionarily conserved gene whose function is unknown. Here, 
      we report eight unrelated families from which 20 children presented with a fatal 
      syndrome consisting of severe autoinflammation and progredient leukoencephalopathy 
      with recurrent seizures; 12 of these subjects, whose DNA was available, segregated 
      homozygous loss-of-function C2orf69 variants. C2ORF69 bears homology to esterase 
      enzymes, and orthologs can be found in most eukaryotic genomes, including that of 
      unicellular phytoplankton. We found that endogenous C2ORF69 (1) is loosely bound to 
      mitochondria, (2) affects mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative respiration 
      in cultured neurons, and (3) controls the levels of the glycogen branching enzyme 1 
      (GBE1) consistent with a glycogen-storage-associated mitochondriopathy. We show that 
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated inactivation of zebrafish C2orf69 results in lethality by 
      8 months of age due to spontaneous epileptic seizures, which is preceded by 
      persistent brain inflammation. Collectively, our results delineate an 
      autoinflammatory Mendelian disorder of C2orf69 deficiency that disrupts the 
      development/homeostasis of the immune and central nervous systems.

TI  - A dominant-negative effect drives selection of TP53 missense mutations in myeloid 
      malignancies.
PG  - 599-604
LID - 10.1126/science.aax3649 [doi]
AB  - TP53, which encodes the tumor suppressor p53, is the most frequently mutated gene in 
      human cancer. The selective pressures shaping its mutational spectrum, dominated by 
      missense mutations, are enigmatic, and neomorphic gain-of-function (GOF) activities 
      have been implicated. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate isogenic human leukemia cell 
      lines of the most common TP53 missense mutations. Functional, DNA-binding, and 
      transcriptional analyses revealed loss of function but no GOF effects. Comprehensive 
      mutational scanning of p53 single-amino acid variants demonstrated that missense 
      variants in the DNA-binding domain exert a dominant-negative effect (DNE). In mice, 
      the DNE of p53 missense variants confers a selective advantage to hematopoietic 
      cells on DNA damage. Analysis of clinical outcomes in patients with acute myeloid 
      leukemia showed no evidence of GOF for TP53 missense mutations. Thus, a DNE is the 
      primary unit of selection for TP53 missense mutations in myeloid malignancies.

AB  - Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a heritable congenital heart defect and an important 
      risk factor for valvulopathy and aortopathy. Here we report a genome-wide 
      association scan of 466 BAV cases and 4,660 age, sex and ethnicity-matched controls 
      with replication in up to 1,326 cases and 8,103 controls. We identify association 
      with a noncoding variant 151 kb from the gene encoding the cardiac-specific 
      transcription factor, GATA4, and near-significance for p.Ser377Gly in GATA4. GATA4 
      was interrupted by CRISPR-Cas9 in induced pluripotent stem cells from healthy 
      donors. The disruption of GATA4 significantly impaired the transition from 
      endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a critical step in heart valve 
      development.

TI  - Functional annotation of the 2q35 breast cancer risk locus implicates a structural 
      variant in influencing activity of a long-range enhancer element.

AB  - A combination of genetic and functional approaches has identified three independent 
      breast cancer risk loci at 2q35. A recent fine-scale mapping analysis to refine 
      these associations resulted in 1 (signal 1), 5 (signal 2), and 42 (signal 3) 
      credible causal variants at these loci. We used publicly available in silico DNase I 
      and ChIP-seq data with in vitro reporter gene and CRISPR assays to annotate signals 
      2 and 3. We identified putative regulatory elements that enhanced cell-type-specific 
      transcription from the IGFBP5 promoter at both signals (30- to 40-fold increased 
      expression by the putative regulatory element at signal 2, 2- to 3-fold by the 
      putative regulatory element at signal 3). We further identified one of the five 
      credible causal variants at signal 2, a 1.4 kb deletion (esv3594306), as the likely 
      causal variant; the deletion allele of this variant was associated with an average 
      additional increase in IGFBP5 expression of 1.3-fold (MCF-7) and 2.2-fold (T-47D). 
      We propose a model in which the deletion allele of esv3594306 juxtaposes two 
      transcription factor binding regions (annotated by estrogen receptor alpha ChIP-seq 
      peaks) to generate a single extended regulatory element. This regulatory element 
      increases cell-type-specific expression of the tumor suppressor gene IGFBP5 and, 
      thereby, reduces risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (odds ratio = 
      0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.81, p = 3.1 × 10(-31)).
